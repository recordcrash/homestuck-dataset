After a series of frustrations brought on by Rose\u2019s spotty internet connection, they succeed in creating a tree that bears a blue apple.

He gets a pecking from the crowsprite and falls off. Dave\u2019s Bro lands on the descending meteor and slices it in half with a katana while his rocket board breaks Dave\u2019s fall. The egg cracks, ushering Dave into the Medium.\nAround this time, the kids start getting trolled more often. The troll Terezi contacts John and offers to accelerate his quest by taking him straight to his denizen, Typheus. She leads John back to his house and turns his previous alchemy experiment into a functioning jetpack. John puts the jetpack on and blasts off toward his Seventh Gate.\nAt this point, events diverge into two distinct chronologies: one that reinforces its own existence through stable time loops, and one that doesn\u2019t.\nIn the contradictory \u201cdoomed\u201d timeline, Typheus slays John. Jade never gets into the Medium. Dave and Rose spend the next four months exploring their game session and determining that it is futile. Finally Dave travels back in time to visit his past self. Rose, who cannot go with him, goes to sleep in the hope that her awakened dreamself will in some way survive their dead-end timeline.\nIn the self-fulfilling \u201calpha\u201d timeline, just when Dave has entered the Medium, bringing his apartment to Lohac, the Land of Heat and Clockwork, Doomed Dave arrives from the future and alters the events that caused his doom.

It is Jaspers\u2019 Meow message, a genetic code.\nJohn\u2019s Second Gate takes him to Lolar, where he crashes into Rose\u2019s house and finds her asleep. Snooping around, John finds Rose\u2019s unfinished present to him, a stuffed bunny with knitted patches. He also poses as Rose in reply to the troll Kanaya, tricking her into a marathon of flustered exchanges with Rose. Then he swaps pets with the sleeping girl and blasts off again.\nDream Rose visits Dream Dave, whose unconscious graffiti is of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, and sees on his computer that John is at her house. Waking up too late to meet him, she alchemizes new weapons and vents her frustration on the gathering minions.\nDave wakes up and alchemizes stuff too while Dream Jade builds his house up. Some crafty snooping nets him Rose\u2019s private journals, which contain the Meow genome and a story about wizards. Dave puts them aside, using his juice-stained Sburb envelopes for bookmarks. Meanwhile, the Gods of the Furthest Ring tell Rose to burn her own copy of Meow. She explains to Dave that as Derse dreamers, they hear voices from the infinite void instead of seeing visions in Skaia\u2019s clouds.\nThe Draconian Dignitary, an agent of Derse, sneaks into Dave\u2019s room and steals the journals. Dave returns to find the corpse of another Dave who got in the Dignitary\u2019s way.

The lab is embedded in an asteroid in the Veil. John finds the portal from Lolar to the lab soon after, but by that time the others have departed. The Regulator has taken the rocket board and is flying around the Veil. The guardians are piloting a ship towards Skaia, having left behind Maplehoof and a variety of objects for John to find.\nJohn discovers that the laboratory is equipped to do ectobiology. Ectobiology is the practice of collecting genetic samples by \u201cparadoxifying\u201d targets that cannot be appearified. The samples can be used to make clones and can be combined to create descendants.\nThe lab equipment has been set to paradoxify four people from four different spacetime coordinates on Earth. John sees Nanna, Grandpa, Bro, and Mom on the monitor and appearifies genetic samples from each one in turn. After all their genomes are collected in the form of spooky time slime, the machine gets to work creating clone babies of each one. It also combines Nanna\u2019s sample with Grandpa\u2019s and Bro\u2019s sample with Mom\u2019s, producing a baby son and daughter from each pair.\nWhile John\u2019s ectobiological creations crawl around and attach themselves to the objects lying around the lab, the troll Karkat contacts John and explains what he learned from doing the same thing in the troll session.

Jade knew from her cloud visions that it would be lost inside the plummeting car and would only reach John later, when he is in great peril.\nThe Mistress discovers an enemy Authority Regulator taking two parcels from the wrecked car. One is the green box and the other is an envelope that John has requested. She greets the Regulator and asks for both parcels. He gives her the Sburb server envelope, which she immediately consigns to the Breeze. He keeps the contraband box for his superiors. Determined to get the box back, she follows him to Derse.\nAfter a chance encounter with the Black Queen, who wears a ring giving her the powers of the prototyped kernels, the Mistress finds the box on the desk of Archagent Jack Noir (who looks like Spades Slick). Noir drives a hard bargain: she must bring him the crowns of the White King and Queen. He sends her away with a treasonous mission and a Regisword.\nHis curiosity piqued, Noir looks in the box and discovers the perfect weapon to kill the Black Queen, who is constantly forcing him into foolish clothes. He destroys her utterly, takes her Ring of Orbs Fourfold, and gains its harlequin-jaspers-tentacle-crow powers.\nReturning to Prospit, the Parcel Mistress relates her predicament to the White Queen, who has the same kind of ring. The Queen chooses to abdicate so that the Mistress can fulfill the bargain with Noir. She gives the Mistress her ring and crown and tells her to find the White King on the Battlefield to get his crown too.\nThe Courtyard Droll (who looks like Clubs Deuce) has tailed the Mistress from Derse. He picks her pocket, stealing the ring that was just entrusted to her. She boards a shuttle and flies off to the Battlefield still believing she has it.\nDream Jade notices, beats up the Droll, and takes the ring. It has no power for her, but she puts it on for safekeeping before returning to Dream John\u2019s tower.

One of these farms is tended by the black-shelled Warweary Villein, who despises the eternal war.\nWhen his farm is torched, the Villein snaps and launches a rebellion against both kingdoms, rallying white and black carapacians to his cause. Together they march on the Black King and are about to confront him when Jack Noir arrives. Noir now styles himself the Sovereign Slayer. He has flown to Skaia to complete his stone cold coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by breaking the Black King\u2019s scepter and beheading him. Then he massacres the rebels, sparing only the Villein, and begins to devastate the Battlefield with some super deadly red shit.\nElsewhere on the board, the White King greets the Parcel Mistress and surrenders his crown and scepter to her. The lurking Hegemonic Brute (who looks like Hearts Boxcars) ambushes them, knocking the scepter out of the Mistress\u2019s hand and over a waterfall.\nThe Droll finds the white scepter and brings it to Noir, who uses it to initiate the Reckoning, a process that propels meteors out of the Veil and towards Skaia. Skaia throws up defense portals to intercept these meteors and send them to Earth instead. Each portal is connected to a different moment in Earth\u2019s history. Most of the Veil\u2019s meteors fly through these portals and are sent crashing into the houses and surroundings of Sburb players on Earth. The ones carrying Agents are sent to later times, while the ones carrying babies are sent to earlier times so that they can grow up, participate in Sburb, and contribute to their own creation.

The babies had to come from somewhere.)\nThe Authority Regulator, on his wild ride through the Veil, discovers a meteor with a frog temple on it, an intact version of the ruins on Jade\u2019s island.

The Colonel\u2019s widow Betty Crocker raises the pair as brother and sister, and they grow up to be Nanna Egbert and Grandpa Harley. The monitor has targeted their dog, Halley, for paradoxification.\nThe Draconian Dignitary (who looks like Diamonds Droog) enters the temple lab carrying the journals he stole from Dave\u2019s apartment. The Regulator hides and watches. The Dignitary casts Dave\u2019s juice-stained bookmarks into the time capsule, which stores them for release four hundred million years later, and moves on to the lab\u2019s ectobiology station, which is set to make an organism by combining Halley\u2019s genome with a genetic code to be input by the user. The Dignitary inputs Rose\u2019s Meow code and Becquerel is born.\nThe Regulator flees the temple and returns to John\u2019s meteor. He finds the boy asleep as the meteor plummets out of the Veil and the transportalizers break. To get John safely off the rock, the Regulator ties John to the rocket board and sends him flying back to his land. With no escape for himself, the Regulator rides the meteor to Earth.\nThe Sovereign Slayer flies up from the Battlefield and hits Prospit with the deadly Red Miles. The White Queen escapes on a ship and heads for a Skaian defense portal.

At the last moment, she throws him to safety and perishes in the impact. He wakes on the Battlefield and takes the Ring of Orbs Fourfold from her body.\nThe Parcel Mistress slays the Hegemonic Brute with her Regisword and uses his radio to summon Noir. They complete their bargain by exchanging the white crowns for the green box, which she takes straight to Dream John.\nIn the box, Dream John finds a gift from Jade as well as letters from her and a penpal who helped her build the thing.

She believes trolling the kids is what gets them into this mess. When she warns Rose not to seek the Green Sun, it\u2019s not because she thinks it will change what happens. Trying to change things only reinforces the alpha timeline\u2019s causal loops.\nFeferi, the hero of Life, feels the opposite. She is eager to get to know the kids and convinced that they are the answer to the trolls\u2019 plight. She talks to Jade about how the Gods of the Furthest Ring will help the two races meet in dream bubbles.\nSollux, the hero of Doom, doesn\u2019t care about the kids at all.\nEquius, the hero of Void, tries to decipher the kids\u2019 social hierarchy. His blue blood places him in a noble troll caste, but all humans have bright red blood, an aberrant colour unique to Karkat. Equius trolls Dave about human class structure and they drop delirious flow at each other.\nTavros, the hero of Breath, tries to get Dave\u2019s Earth goat and then moves on to Jade. When he offers to command Becsprite, his awkward confessions earn him the scorn of Jade and also Vriska, who was eavesdropping.\nKarkat, the hero of Blood, hates John at first sight. He flirts caliginously with John to no avail. John has already spoken to him many times and knows him as a friend. Embarrassed by the encounter, he continues trolling John backwards. He gradually warms to the kids and learns that there is a plan to meet up with them after they escape their session. Jade needs his help, so he spends the rest of his trolling efforts trying to talk to Jade at the right times.\nNepeta, the hero of Heart, bonds with Jaspersprite.\nKanaya, the hero of Space, obsesses over Rose. She idolizes the author of the walkthrough she grew up reading and wonders if this underwhelming kid can really be the same person.

She can\u2019t see the doomed timelines she creates, such as the one where John picks a fight with Typheus, but Davesprite gives her some idea. She starts helping Dave when she realizes that the kids and trolls are going to be useful to each other.\nVriska, the hero of Light, makes herself important by manipulating events in the kids\u2019 lives, including their wakefulness at key times, in order to be responsible for creating the demon. She also guides John to godhood, beating Terezi at the chumpy impressionable human boy-off.\nGamzee, the hero of Rage, has run out of the sedative sopor slime he is addicted to.

And then there is Aradia, who is uniquely alive and there in the flesh.\nThe dream bubbles are decorated with scenery from the ghosts\u2019 lives, letting the inhabitants relive old memories without being aware that they have died. Aradia eagerly becomes a psychopomp for these amnesiac ghosts. She talks to them and eases them into awareness.\nThe first bubble Aradia enters is a memory belonging to one of her own doomed selves, an Aradiabot who attacked Noir six hours ago. Noir dispatched this Aradiabot by throwing Lil Cal at her. She travelled back in time to escape the puppet\u2019s awful clutches and was crushed by a meteor speeding toward Skaia during the Reckoning. A defense portal sent this meteor to Alternia some time before Aradia first died. It smashed a hole through the ground and into a cave. The dream bubble shifts to Aradia\u2019s memories of this older event.\nAradia went to look into the cave and found some blue frog ruins like the red ones near Kanaya\u2019s hive. In the impact crater Aradia found the remains of her own future soulbot and, tucked into Lil Cal\u2019s shirt, John\u2019s Dad\u2019s wallet.

They sent Lil Cal to Kanaya for repair.\nWhen the dead doomed Aradia and a dreaming Sollux re\u00ebnact their old conversation without awareness, the living Aradia steps in and helps them remember. Other ghosts and dreamers drift in and out of this bubble. Aradia takes them on a tour through events in their lives, revealing the suppressed memories in which they wrote out pieces of the genetic code that the agents of Derse would use to make Alternia\u2019s First Guardian. Just as Rose wrote part of Becqerel\u2019s genome in a cipher with the letters \u201cMeow\u201d, the trolls wrote part of Doc Scratch\u2019s genome in ciphers with the letters \u201ct1ck t0ck 8r8k H34DS honk HONK\u201d, a harbinger of the Vast Honk foretold in Gamzee\u2019s clown faith. The Black Queen created Doc Scratch by combining these codes with Lil Cal and Vriska\u2019s magic cue ball.\nIn another bubble, Aradia finds Dave reliving a memory of mad snacks, yo.

Tavros threatens to end her inveterate abuse and manipulation. They agree to fight it out, and he goes looking for her.\nTerezi leads a doomed Dave to his death while testing the alpha Dave\u2019s willingness to rise to godhood. Her complicity in this event upsets her. When she runs off in tears, the only trolls left in the computer room are Sollux, Feferi, Karkat, and Kanaya. Karkat is agitated about all the fucks going rogue, especially Gamzee, who hasn\u2019t been seen since watching Dave\u2019s juggalo video.\nA key discovery in the lab has suggested to Kanaya that the time is right to use the Matriorb, an egg she harvested from her dead mother grub lusus. She hopes to relaunch the Alternian race by hatching the Matriorb in the core of the meteor. But before she can leave for the core, Eridan enters.\nEridan picks a fight with Sollux by declaring his intention to defect and serve Noir. Feferi and Sollux decide that Eridan must be stopped. Eridan tosses off his cape and they duel. With his wand, he is more powerful than when they fought on Lobaf. The gold blood takes a crushing blow and slumps against the wall.\nFeferi makes a move to retaliate, but Eridan is quicker on the draw. His bolt of white science impales her in the collapsing and expanding bladder-based aquatic vascular system. The fuchsia blood falls dead on the horn pile.\nFinally, Eridan provokes Kanaya by blowing up the Matriorb. She lunges at him and gets a bolt through the torso for her trouble. The jade blood falls sort of dead on the floor. Having completed his rampage, Eridan leaves the computer room.\nKarkat snaps out of shocked bystander mode and examines the bodies, finding Sollux to be in stable condition. Messages arrive from Doc Scratch and Gamzee that make Karkat fear for his life. Gamzee has embraced the violent psychosis that is his calling as a purple blood. He promises to kill everyone.\nTavros finds Vriska on a high walkway. He charges at her and is impaled. Vriska sticks the bronze blood with his own lance and throws him off the walkway. He drops a great height and falls dead on the ground behind Terezi, who is alone.\nTerezi investigates and pins the murder on Vriska. She sends her findings to Karkat, then takes her computer glasses off and kisses Tavros\u2019s corpse in the vain hope that he might have a dream self to revive. Karkat, weeping, does the same for Kanaya. Nothing comes of their heartfelt corpsesmooches.\nKarkat drags the unconscious Sollux out of the computer room in search of a place to hide from Gamzee. At the top of a staircase, Karkat hears a scary honk and panics. He and Sollux happen to\u00d7 fall down the stairs. The tumble knocks Sollux\u2019s fangs out. Karkat finally responds to Terezi\u2019s message, only to find Gamzee on the line. Fearing the worst, Karkat appeals to Equius to fight back against the psychopaths.\nTerezi leaves for the computer room without her glasses, letting Gamzee steal them. Gamzee cuts off and makes out with Tavros\u2019s head. He gets revenge on Dave by subjecting him and John to psychic chucklevoodoos that trouble their dreams. In Dave\u2019s case, the chucklevoodoos create an instance of Lil Cal, and in John\u2019s case, they cause the unconscious clown scribbles that would contribute to the harlequin prototyping.\nEquius makes Nepeta hide in a safe room while he goes looking for the violent highbloods, but she is not content to sit still. She enters the air ducts and crawls around. She sees Equius through a grate and watches as Gamzee kills him. Gamzee first shoots an arrow into Equius\u2019s knee, then garrottes him with the bowstring. The indigo blood offers no resistance and chokes with a smile on his face.\nLosing her moirail spurs Nepeta to attack. She leaps out of the grate at Gamzee. It ends no better for the olive blood than for the other three trolls who lunged at their foes. Gamzee uses her claws for war paint and then clubs her to death.\nTerezi returns unharmed to the computer room and smells another murder to pin on Vriska. But the crime scene is not how Karkat left it. Kanaya\u2019s body and Eridan\u2019s cape are gone and there is a bite on Feferi\u2019s neck. This evidence is strange to Terezi. She couldn\u2019t know that Kanaya is now an undead rainbow drinker.\nTerezi tries messaging Karkat again and ends up chatting with Sollux. He has recovered from the blow he suffered in the duel, but there are lasting effects. He is now blind, lispless, and free from the voices of the soon-to-die.

This may or may not be true of trolls properly hatched from the Mother Grub, but Karkat ensured it would be true for the players of Sgrub when he cloned them with ectobiology. Just like John\u2019s babies, Karkat made two sets of twelve baby troll grubs. The Reckoning delivered these grubs to their home planet by meteors.

Trying to change things only reinforces the alpha timeline\u2019s causal loops.\nFeferi, the hero of Life, feels the opposite. She is eager to get to know the kids and convinced that they are the answer to the trolls\u2019 plight. She talks to Jade about how the Gods of the Furthest Ring will help the two races meet in dream bubbles.\nSollux, the hero of Doom, doesn\u2019t care about the kids at all.\nEquius, the hero of Void, tries to decipher the kids\u2019 social hierarchy. His blue blood places him in a noble troll caste, but all humans have bright red blood, an aberrant colour unique to Karkat. Equius trolls Dave about human class structure and they drop delirious flow at each other.\nTavros, the hero of Breath, tries to get Dave\u2019s Earth goat and then moves on to Jade. When he offers to command Becsprite, his awkward confessions earn him the scorn of Jade and also Vriska, who was eavesdropping.\nKarkat, the hero of Blood, hates John at first sight. He flirts caliginously with John to no avail. John has already spoken to him many times and knows him as a friend. Embarrassed by the encounter, he continues trolling John backwards. He gradually warms to the kids and learns that there is a plan to meet up with them after they escape their session. Jade needs his help, so he spends the rest of his trolling efforts trying to talk to Jade at the right times.\nNepeta, the hero of Heart, bonds with Jaspersprite.\nKanaya, the hero of Space, obsesses over Rose. She idolizes the author of the walkthrough she grew up reading and wonders if this underwhelming kid can really be the same person.

When Rose blows up his computer, he persuades Kanaya to make him a wand. The wand\nbecomes his preferred weapon even as he insists magic is fake. He gives Jade his rifle, Ahab\u2019s Crosshairs.\nTerezi, the hero of Mind, is the most successful troll at first. She can\u2019t see the doomed timelines she creates, such as the one where John picks a fight with Typheus, but Davesprite gives her some idea. She starts helping Dave when she realizes that the kids and trolls are going to be useful to each other.\nVriska, the hero of Light, makes herself important by manipulating events in the kids\u2019 lives, including their wakefulness at key times, in order to be responsible for creating the demon. She also guides John to godhood, beating Terezi at the chumpy impressionable human boy-off.\nGamzee, the hero of Rage, has run out of the sedative sopor slime he is addicted to.

And then there is Aradia, who is uniquely alive and there in the flesh.\nThe dream bubbles are decorated with scenery from the ghosts\u2019 lives, letting the inhabitants relive old memories without being aware that they have died. Aradia eagerly becomes a psychopomp for these amnesiac ghosts. She talks to them and eases them into awareness.\nThe first bubble Aradia enters is a memory belonging to one of her own doomed selves, an Aradiabot who attacked Noir six hours ago. Noir dispatched this Aradiabot by throwing Lil Cal at her. She travelled back in time to escape the puppet\u2019s awful clutches and was crushed by a meteor speeding toward Skaia during the Reckoning.

They sent Lil Cal to Kanaya for repair.\nWhen the dead doomed Aradia and a dreaming Sollux re\u00ebnact their old conversation without awareness, the living Aradia steps in and helps them remember. Other ghosts and dreamers drift in and out of this bubble. Aradia takes them on a tour through events in their lives, revealing the suppressed memories in which they wrote out pieces of the genetic code that the agents of Derse would use to make Alternia\u2019s First Guardian. Just as Rose wrote part of Becqerel\u2019s genome in a cipher with the letters \u201cMeow\u201d, the trolls wrote part of Doc Scratch\u2019s genome in ciphers with the letters \u201ct1ck t0ck 8r8k H34DS honk HONK\u201d, a harbinger of the Vast Honk foretold in Gamzee\u2019s clown faith. The Black Queen created Doc Scratch by combining these codes with Lil Cal and Vriska\u2019s magic cue ball.\nIn another bubble, Aradia finds Dave reliving a memory of mad snacks, yo.

Her complicity in this event upsets her. When she runs off in tears, the only trolls left in the computer room are Sollux, Feferi, Karkat, and Kanaya. Karkat is agitated about all the fucks going rogue, especially Gamzee, who hasn\u2019t been seen since watching Dave\u2019s juggalo video.\nA key discovery in the lab has suggested to Kanaya that the time is right to use the Matriorb, an egg she harvested from her dead mother grub lusus. She hopes to relaunch the Alternian race by hatching the Matriorb in the core of the meteor. But before she can leave for the core, Eridan enters.\nEridan picks a fight with Sollux by declaring his intention to defect and serve Noir. Feferi and Sollux decide that Eridan must be stopped. Eridan tosses off his cape and they duel. With his wand, he is more powerful than when they fought on Lobaf. The gold blood takes a crushing blow and slumps against the wall.\nFeferi makes a move to retaliate, but Eridan is quicker on the draw. His bolt of white science impales her in the collapsing and expanding bladder-based aquatic vascular system. The fuchsia blood falls dead on the horn pile.\nFinally, Eridan provokes Kanaya by blowing up the Matriorb. She lunges at him and gets a bolt through the torso for her trouble. The jade blood falls sort of dead on the floor. Having completed his rampage, Eridan leaves the computer room.\nKarkat snaps out of shocked bystander mode and examines the bodies, finding Sollux to be in stable condition. Messages arrive from Doc Scratch and Gamzee that make Karkat fear for his life. Gamzee has embraced the violent psychosis that is his calling as a purple blood.

He drops a great height and falls dead on the ground behind Terezi, who is alone.\nTerezi investigates and pins the murder on Vriska. She sends her findings to Karkat, then takes her computer glasses off and kisses Tavros\u2019s corpse in the vain hope that he might have a dream self to revive. Karkat, weeping, does the same for Kanaya. Nothing comes of their heartfelt corpsesmooches.\nKarkat drags the unconscious Sollux out of the computer room in search of a place to hide from Gamzee. At the top of a staircase, Karkat hears a scary honk and panics. He and Sollux happen to\u00d7 fall down the stairs. The tumble knocks Sollux\u2019s fangs out. Karkat finally responds to Terezi\u2019s message, only to find Gamzee on the line. Fearing the worst, Karkat appeals to Equius to fight back against the psychopaths.\nTerezi leaves for the computer room without her glasses, letting Gamzee steal them. Gamzee cuts off and makes out with Tavros\u2019s head. He gets revenge on Dave by subjecting him and John to psychic chucklevoodoos that trouble their dreams. In Dave\u2019s case, the chucklevoodoos create an instance of Lil Cal, and in John\u2019s case, they cause the unconscious clown scribbles that would contribute to the harlequin prototyping.\nEquius makes Nepeta hide in a safe room while he goes looking for the violent highbloods, but she is not content to sit still. She enters the air ducts and crawls around. She sees Equius through a grate and watches as Gamzee kills him. Gamzee first shoots an arrow into Equius\u2019s knee, then garrottes him with the bowstring. The indigo blood offers no resistance and chokes with a smile on his face.\nLosing her moirail spurs Nepeta to attack. She leaps out of the grate at Gamzee. It ends no better for the olive blood than for the other three trolls who lunged at their foes. Gamzee uses her claws for war paint and then clubs her to death.\nTerezi returns unharmed to the computer room and smells another murder to pin on Vriska. But the crime scene is not how Karkat left it. Kanaya\u2019s body and Eridan\u2019s cape are gone and there is a bite on Feferi\u2019s neck. This evidence is strange to Terezi. She couldn\u2019t know that Kanaya is now an undead rainbow drinker.\nTerezi tries messaging Karkat again and ends up chatting with Sollux. He has recovered from the blow he suffered in the duel, but there are lasting effects. He is now blind, lispless, and free from the voices of the soon-to-die.

This may or may not be true of trolls properly hatched from the Mother Grub, but Karkat ensured it would be true for the players of Sgrub when he cloned them with ectobiology. Just like John\u2019s babies, Karkat made two sets of twelve baby troll grubs. The Reckoning delivered these grubs to their home planet by meteors. The player grubs all landed on Alternia six solar sweeps before the Vast Glub, while the ancestor grubs landed and lived out their lives in different times in Alternia\u2019s history.\nWhen Vriska was little, she found the diary and belongings of her ancestor, Marquise Mindfang, a swashbuckling gamblignant.

After losing her whole empire in the Vast Glub, the Condesce was pressed into Lrd English\u2019s loathsome service to carry out his will in the universe of Earth.\nTaking the name Crocker, she insinuated herself into human society as the wife of Colonel Sassacre. She raised Jane\u2019s Poppop (baby John) and Jake\u2019s Grandma (baby Jade) after they fell to Earth on meteors in 1910. Their upbringing echoed that of pre-Scratch Nanna and Grandpa. Leaving home, Grandma took the name English to spite the cruel Batterwitch, while Poppop Crocker stayed and became a comedian and TV actor. Poppop was killed by the meteor that delivered Jane and her dirty hat.\nThe fish queen\u2019s harmless \u201cBetty Crocker\u201d persona masked an agenda of world domination. Her mastery of the blueblood and lowblood psionics allowed her to zonk people at will and command animals including Earth\u2019s First Guardian, GCat. She used these abilities and her baking enterprise to quietly gain power over humans.\nGrandma was the first to resist her adoptive mother\u2019s tyranny. Grandma ran the competing company Skaianet and raised Jake on the Pacific island with the frog ruins. When Jake was little, the Condesce murdered Grandma and blew up her house on the hill. After that, Jake lived in the jungle where his bedroom, severed from the house in the blast, had come to rest. Condy started breeding Alternian lusus naturae on his island.\nThe other two heroes of the resistance were Dirk\u2019s Bro (baby Dave) and Roxy\u2019s Mom (baby Rose). Bro directed the unwatchable Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff movies starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Mom wrote the impossible Complacency of the Learned wizard novels. But the political messages in their art could not prevent the Baroness from manoeuvring key Crockercorp shills into positions of power.\nHer Condescension\u2019s cronies gradually perverted human politics and civilization. In the years after the Rebranding, Earth turned into a brutal hellhole ruled by juggalos. High Chaplain Fieri and Dual-Presidents Jay and Dope oversaw the death of billions.\nIn the last gasp of the resistance movement, Bro and Mom assassinated the Presidents and the Chaplain. Then they faced off against the Batterwitch herself, and died at her hands.\nLife got even worse for the survivors of the Hilarocaust. After the Condesce took direct control, she flooded the world and subjected the remainder of humanity to a series of cruel experiments. She was trying to mould Earth into something like her old Alternian empire. But after centuries of failures, humanity went extinct.\nTo replace humans, Condy went to the Medium, rounded up some Prospitians and Dersites, and stuck them in floating chessboard ghettos on Earth. One such colony was erected around Mom\u2019s house, which blended in architecturally. Baby Roxy landed there and grew up among the hungry carapacians. Baby Dirk landed thousands of miles away. He grew up alone in his Bro\u2019s mostly submerged high-rise apartment.\nAt the end of Dirk\u2019s history, Jake realizes he is reliving the conversation three years later while unconscious in the temple.

Meenah was the heir to the Beforan empire, but did not want the responsibility. Beforan troll society was built on noblesse oblige. Each blood caste served and cared for those under it, and Meenah\u2019s rare fuchsia caste bore the greatest duty of care of all. Meenah fled to Beforus\u2019s pink moon to avoid being made empress.\nMeenah discovered Sgrub on the moon and convinced her friends to play it with her. There were twelve players in all. They entered the Medium, lost the game, and scratched their session so that their twelve ancestors could play instead.\nNormally, a scratch resets the world the players came from so that their lives never happened. To keep existing, a player has to escape the session before the scratch is completed. Rose and Dave did this by flying out into the Furthest Ring. Jade and John did it by flying through the Fourth Wall. But Meenah used a different kind of escape route. At the onset of her scratch, she killed herself and her eleven comrades with a bomb. They became dream bubble ghosts, existing beyond the reach of the hard reset that turned Beforus into Alternia.\n(The scratch in the Beforan session made Skaia switch the destinations of the defense portals in the Alternian session, where Karkat ectobiologized all 24 players by paradox cloning. According to Doc Scratch, players are not supposed to be created in a post-scratch session. When they are, it is an unfortunate glitch that indicates Lrd English will prey on their universe.)\nIn her ageless journey through ghost and dreamer memories, Aranea has learned about the lives she and her friends led on the other side of the scratch.

This must be one of the many events in Jake\u2019s upcoming session that are obscured from the reader by trickster magic and special stardust.\nLittle Terry shrinks the weapons down to bunny size. Jake writes a note to introduce the bunny to John, the kid who will eventually receive it, although Jake still believes he is addressing his Grandma and Jane\u2019s Poppop in the past. He puts the robot bunny on the transmaterializer and sends it across the scratch to Jade. Jade packs it up and sends it on to John. As seen in Acts 4 and 5, the bunny ends up changing hands and fortunes in the pre-scratch session and gets renamed Liv Tyler before being unmade in the creation of the Green Sun.\nHis job done, Jake goes to fetch the infinitesimalated house remnant that fell down the elevator shaft. He extracts a miniature fourth wall from the house ball and keeps it for later.

These towers reward him with views of the Alpha session that he and Calliope were never able to see in the Trollian viewport. After seeing many of Jane\u2019s private moments, Caliborn tells her how pleased he is to see her get fat while her Dad gets brutalized and killed in Derse jail. This is a lie, calculated to tip Jane into despair. Dad Crocker is fine. He is enjoying cushy VIP treatment and social media stardom on Derse because the Draconian Dignitary admires his businesslike fashion sense. But Jane doesn\u2019t know that. \nMeanwhile, a second human gets put in jail. When Jane leaves Roxy alone with GCat, the First Guardian teleports Roxy straight to its master, the Condesce. Roxy falls to Derse from a great height and gets knocked out.\nNow that she has no dreamself, Roxy starts dreaming in a bubble. In her dream, she recalls writing Wizardy Herbert, a self-parodying novel about children at a magic summer camp, Herbert and Beatrix, who recognize that they are inside a story that represents little Roxy\u2019s earliest attempts at Complacency fanfiction.\nDisguised as Twinkly Herbert the firefly, Calliope\u2019s ghost enters the dream and leads Roxy into a silent sanctuary where she has been hiding ever since she died. Calliope greets Roxy wearing her trollsona. She is uncomfortable being a cherub and would rather be a troll.\nCallie reports that her brother has become Lrd English. He is chasing an army of ghosts around the Furthest Ring, hoping to find and annihilate her soul. There are rumours that the Calliope he is looking for is one who predominated and died in a doomed timeline. Callie thinks she should look for this other Calliope too. But for now, she is just hiding.\nCallie tells Roxy to focus on her game session. She says Roxy and the other Nobles should go die in their quest crypts in order to reach the god tiers and prevail in the next day\u2019s battle.\nAt this point, a dreaming Rose stumbles across Callie and Roxy\u2019s bubble. Callie panics, fearing the Seer of Light will draw attention to her hiding place. She shooes Rose and Roxy out to the waking world before they can get acquainted.\nRoxy wakes in a jail cell on Derse. She learns that Betty Crocker has a job for her. The Courtyard Droll gives Roxy the Black Queen\u2019s ring of orbs nofold, presumably to boost her voidy powers so she can do this job. But the job is stupid and impossible and Roxy is not willing to help the cruel Batterwitch.\nWearing the ring, Roxy learns how to become invisible and immaterial. She sneaks out of the hag slammer. While walking around unseen by the Dersites, she messages her co-players to tell them about god tiering. Alas, she is invisible online too. None of the kids read her messages.\nOn Lotak, Lil Hal wants to be put into the kernelsprite, but Dirk is not inclined to honour his promise. Dirk thinks his AI self already sabotages his relationships and controls his life too much without sprite powers. In his bitterness, Dirk comes close to killing the Auto Responder. By the time he backs down, Gamzee has gotten to the kernelsprite first. But Equiusprite can receive one more prototyping, so Dirk throws AR in anyway, making Arquiusprite.\nArquiusprite loves being strong and loves horses. Why horses? Is it supposed to be ironic or something, that his very desire is to be in the proximity of some horses? Just think it over. Think it over."], ["THEY GET SUCKERED", "Caliborn jeers Jake with the stated aim of grooming a worthy adversary. Caliborn says it is inevitable that the Lord of Time will come to dominate all of existence, no matter how much he must suffer and toil first. The Page of Hope, on the other hand, is worthless by default and must be given a free powerup before he can hope to challenge the Lord.\nCaliborn gives Jake the code for his old juju, a wondrous object that cannot be duplicated. It will leave Caliborn\u2019s possession once it is created somewhere else. When combined with his sister\u2019s juju, its beneviolent effect will be great indeed. Caliborn would have combined them himself but found Calliope\u2019s half missing. Instead, he parts with his half after welcoming an even better juju into his life, the fluffy false man Lil Cal, which Gamzee dug out of the dead dry Earth. Caliborn has bonded with the puppet. He knows someday, somehow, he will use Lil Cal to inflict his hideous soul on everybody who ever shares a universe with it.\nJake doesn\u2019t want Caliborn\u2019s hand-me-downs. He passes the code on to Jane. At the same time, Jane receives a single message from Calliope. Before Calliope died, she followed a suggestion from Skaia\u2019s cloud visions and sent the miserable birthday girl the code for her old juju. So Jane finds herself holding both codes.\nJane reads these messages on the only communicator she has left, a Crockercorp tiaratop, which makes her available to the Baroness\u2019s tacky style of mind control. She throws off the tiara in disgust, but she doesn\u2019t break it like she broke her other devices.\nJane makes the juju items. They are both lollipops, and they fuse together forming a sucker coloured with a red and green spiral. Jane is irresistably drawn to lick it. The juju\u2019s asshole candy magic turns her into Trickster Jane, superpowered and super peachy.\nTrickster Jane flies from Locah to Lomax and spreads the enchantment to Jake. He becomes Trickster Jake. Then they take Erisolsprite with them to Derse and infect Roxy. She becomes Trickster Roxy.\nRoxy is alcoholic. She has carefully stayed sober for months despite living in a house full of booze. But as Trickster Roxy, she instantly falls off the wagon. When she takes Jane and Jake home to pick up Fefetasprite, the Tricksters and the tag-along Courtyard Droll all get shitfaced and throw bottles around.\nThe last stop on their candy giggle rampage is Lotak, where they turn Dirk into Trickster Dirk. But unlike the others, Dirk\u2019s mind is not altered by the juju magic. Even after succumbing to the fabled peachbirth trance of the jokebollocks, he is still unhappy and unable to pretend that all his personal problems have been solved.\nArquiusprite meets Fefetasprite and has a pang of guilt for causing Nepeta\u2019s death. But his apology to the Nepeta half goes even worse than Erisolsprite\u2019s apology to the Feferi half. Their bickering makes Fefetasprite explode.\nThe Tricksters alchemize a bunch of zilly weapons from cherubim folklore including a Warhammer that ends up with John during his session, a couple of zilly rapping robots, and a disgusting surfeit of zilly Santa figurines."], ["THEY COME TO", "Whatever else the kids do under the Trickster influence goes unrecorded. Caliborn next sees them suffering the aftereffects. This upsets him, because he loved the Tricksters and wanted to see everything they did. With a bit of teamwork, a concept new to the antisocial child, he and Gamzee unlock the next two monitors. They combine their chucklevoodoos to send a care package to Archagent Jack Noir in the kids\u2019 session, who is still in jail on Prospit.\nThe Nobles come to in their quest crypts. Dirk and Roxy are in the crypt of Derse\u2019s moon. Jake and Jane are in the crypt of Prospit\u2019s moon. They are lying on sacrificial slabs bearing the symbols of Heart, Void, Hope, and Life, and they have hangovers.\nThey all know they must die on their slabs in order to rise up, but the only thing they kill is time. They proceed to have the most uncomfortable long-distance feelings jam in the history of Paradox Space. Due to regrets and hand wringing, some of them aren\u2019t talking to each other. Jane and Dirk look back on the Jakestakes which divided them. Jake agonizes to Roxy about being a bad friend and a coward. Roxy opens up to Jane about her struggle with drink and to Jake about her fruitless pursuit of Dirk. Dirk praises Roxy for being the strongest of them all.\nIt becomes clear that the Nobles\u2019 enemies will slay them before they do it themselves. Jack Noir\u2019s care package contains Crowbar\u2019s crowbar and the instance of Lil Cal that Gamzee gave to the Droll when he arrived in the kids\u2019 session. When Jack looks into Lil Cal\u2019s eyes, he is hypnotized and undergoes a completely bonkers transformation. He cuts his eyes out and puts Cal\u2019s eyes in his sockets. They change into Lrd English\u2019s table stickball eyes. Jack saws off his shackled leg, glows with weird power, vaporizes half of Prospit around him, and emerges wielding the crowbar. Then he turns his crazy bastard gaze towards Prospit\u2019s moon and fires his mouth laser. Meanwhile, the Condesce turns her psionic tyrant gaze towards Derse\u2019s moon and fires her eye lasers. Prospit\u2019s moon and Derse\u2019s moon blow up. The life lanterns on Locah blow up.\nThe kids die and ascend to godhood. Jane rises up as the Maid of Life. Jake rises up as the Page of Hope.

Finding the Archagent lunging at Jane and Jake with maniac intent, Jade stops Jack and teleports him to the edge of the Furthest Ring, where he will not trouble anyone for some time.\nThis is when the Condesce springs her trap. The troll queen inflicts a mixture of psychic powers on Jade, who has been part dog and susceptible to bronze-blooded animal communion since merging with Becsprite.

It\u2019s still mostly Vriska\u2019s plan. Meenah is happy as long as she gets to say she\u2019s in charge. Aranea has given up her search for the ghost of Calliope, but it is convenient for the trio that their enemy seems to think he will find Calliope by following them.\nThe Serkets are mindjacking some troll ghost suckers and using the resulting crowds as bait to draw Lrd English to areas of the Ring where his terrible ghost-killing breath will crack space and fill the gaps in Vriska\u2019s treasure maps. They have sacrificed thousands of ghosts in this way. Soon they will reach the treasure, which they hope to use as a weapon against the unstoppable Lord of Time.\nWhen John finds them, their treasure hunt has taken on a fun petticoat seagrift theme. Their pirate buddies include Tavros, Nepeta, and Feferi. Aradia and Sollux are also on board as specialists. Sollux is now fully alive after Erisolsprite took his dead half. John spends his whole dream sailing with the gamblignants, hearing their news and stories."], ["THEY PLAY A GAME", "During the last leg of their voyage, Aranea tells what she knows about the origin of Lrd English.\nAranea begins by describing the cosmic, caliginous, serpentine mating dance of adult cherubim. One cherub, after losing to its mate, laid an egg on the dead dry Earth and then flew away. Earth had been relocated to another universe. It now orbited a star nearing supernova. From the egg hatched Calliope and Caliborn. Like other cherubim, their personalities divided in infancy and began to vie for dominance over their body. But here the cherub norms ended.\nFor two reasons, Cal\u2019s childhood was not typical of their species. First, there was an enigmatic acolyte on Earth who prepared for their arrival, cared for them, and then locked them in a room for most of their lives. Second, they were fated to play Sburb, the game in which universes procreate. Such a willful creature as Caliborn would upset the balance of all Paradox Space if he were allowed to play this game, and so he did.\n(Aranea does not know that the acolyte was Gamzee, or that he followed Caliborn into the Medium and served him there too.)\nCaliborn predominated over Calliope, who had hoped in vain that they would play together. Instead, Caliborn played alone. He entered a dead session, the most solitary and empty and unwinnable kind.\nAfter a bunch of tedium, Caliborn made it to his denizen, Yaldabaoth. The god of monsters offered Caliborn the most radical choice any player could make: either magnanimous martyrdom, or constant conquest.\nWhen Caliborn chose the path of the conqueror, he was forced to prove himself in a unique challenge. His Medium became a game of eight-ball pool. After three planets sank in the break, his task was to pocket the remaining twelve by propelling them into the singularity that was once Skaia. Each conquered planet rewarded him with a baize-skinned leprechaun servant with silly time powers, and so by pocketing all the planets he assembled his entourage, The Felt.\n(Aranea does not know that Caliborn continued to talk to the Author and badger him with questions about The Felt throughout the pool game.)\nWinning the pool game unlocked Caliborn\u2019s true land, the Land of Colours and Mayhem, where he would tool up and then face his denizen again. By defeating Yaldabaoth in battle, Caliborn earned the seemingly impossible boons of immortality and limitless power. His soul was then channeled into a juju that would bring unfathomable evil and destruction to any realm in which it materialized.\n(There are critical gaps in Aranea\u2019s knowledge of this last part. It\u2019s all revealed in the next Act Act.)"], ["THEY SPELUNK", "The path to the treasure ends in a memory of a green skull cave. The pirate crew disembark and enter the cave.\nOn the way in, Aranea tries to tell a story about a pair of legendary rings whose fates are intertwined. The Ring of Void was a Black Queen\u2019s ring of orbs nofold whose wearer could vanish into obscurity. The Ring of Life, first discovered by travelers in a desert, could bring ghosts back to life.\nAt this point, Vriska has a dramatic outburst that derails Aranea\u2019s story and causes one of the most mindless amporatry slams in the history of Paradox Space. Vriska was in a memory of sand and zephyr when she rejected the Author\u2019s marriage proposal. Tavros and John later found the Author\u2019s ring in the same spot. Vriska realizes now that the place and the object match Aranea\u2019s description. She almost had the Ring of Life herself.\nVriska grills Tavros and orders him to help her look for the ring again. Tavros gets fed up with her unpleasantness and quits the expedition. Sollux, Nepeta, and Feferi follow his lead, ollying outie while Vriska curses their mutiny.\nJohn reveals that he has the Ring of Life in the waking world. It came with him when he woke up last time. But he disappoints Vriska by not agreeing to give it to her. He doesn\u2019t like how she has trashed the afterlife to find this treasure, and he would rather decide freely what to do with the ring.\nPlaytime is over.

Vriska doesn\u2019t know what it could be, but she hopes to wield it against Lrd English and kill him for good.\nMeenah, Aranea, Aradia and John watch as Vriska opens the chest and dumps the treasure out. It\u2019s a hole in canon, shaped like the Sburb house logo.

His sleeping body also disappears from the couch on the battleship.\nJohn begins to travel through canonspace.

Future John removes Present John before he is noticed, putting the scene back on its original track.\nUnlike previous retjohns, this one does not overwrite the pages in which things went differently. The Homestuck canon includes both versions of the scene, even though the version on pages 6402\u201304 seems not to have happened from the perspective of anyone in the other version. Let us reflect on how puzzling this is.\nWith Dave and Aradia\u2019s doomed offshoots, it was always the case that the doomed time players brought their knowledge of the offshoot with them to the alpha timeline. Rose even gained memories of a doomed self who did not make the trip. Similarly, the Signless Sufferer gained memories from his otherwise scratched Beforan self, Kankri. The offshoots and annihilated realities we know of are those which send information about themselves to the alpha reality.\nFor this to also be true of the retjohns, we would expect Future John to be from the averted future, but we discover later that he is from the reinforced future. No one came from the averted path, and no one but the reader is aware of it. What\u2019s more, despite Dave\u2019s unease, it isn\u2019t obvious whether he is in a doomed timeline or a viable one in which Sburb might still be completed.\nAre we to read this non-scene as nothing more than a demonstration of John\u2019s new power, or does it have some hidden connection to events on the main path?

After narrating his future downfall, Caliborn predicts that Lil Cal will resurface in the nightmares of many universes and release its trapped souls in the form of Lrd English.\nThe curtains fall on Homosuck. Caliborn relinquishes the narrative prompt and goes to battle Yaldabaoth.\nThe revelation of Lil Cal\u2019s hybrid nature hits the reader like a brick. We realize how, all this time, Lrd English and his puppet servant Doc Scratch have embodied a fusion of Caliborn\u2019s soul with those of Equius, Auto Responder, and Gamzee."], ["VRISKAGRAM", "Enough of that.

As before, Dave, Rose, and the Vagabond join the crew while Sollux and Aradia stay in the Furthest Ring.\nThe rooftop meeting starts with Gamzee hog-tied instead of pap-shooshed. Vriska neutralizes Gamzee\u2019s antics for the rest of the trip. She gives him no opportunity to toy with Karkat\u2019s pale affections or Terezi\u2019s caliginous ones. She foils whatever he was plotting with his dancestor Kurloz. She takes his place in hoarding the corpses and Aradia\u2019s music boxes too.\nUntil now, we have only seen Terezi and Vriska in bitter schism after Vriska\u2019s flarping misdeeds. In their youth, these two were the inseperable Team Scourge. Now they are back. The retcon lets Terezi forgive Vriska and restore their old bond. They become moirails.\nWith those two off gigglescheming, Karkat and Dave turn to each other for companionship instead of fighting over Terezi. They become something more than friends.\nAs before, Rose and Kanaya fall in love. Vriska third-wheels on them and puts a stop to Rose\u2019s drinking as soon as she sees it.\nThe crew meet their dancestors as they fly through dream bubbles. Vriska\u2019s yawning disdain for the Beforan ghosts tempers Terezi\u2019s fascination with them. Terezi is never tempted to regain her eyesight. Her crewmates find the ghosts more approachable.\nVriska sees her punk-styled ghost self with Meenah.

She enters the Alpha kids\u2019 Medium, gathers intel, and prepares the ground for the final battle. She wants her teammates to handle the session\u2019s bosses without her. That way, when the time comes, she can return to the Furthest Ring to take on the biggest boss.\nTaking Gamzee\u2019s place as the mischievous dispenser of spirit guides, Vriska greets the Nobles, prototyping their sprites with her stock of refrigerated cadavers.\nJane gets the undivided Tavrosprite, singly prototyped, with room for a tactical second prototyping later on.\nAs before, Dirk and his visitor collaborate to make Arquiusprite, doubly prototyped with Equius and Auto Responder.\nJake and Roxy\u2019s kernelsprites are untouched, with room for two prototypings each. There is no Erisol or Fefeta this time.\nVriska explains later that her prototyping decisions were part atonement, part strategy, and part recusal. \nOther than that, Vriska lets the first five months of the alpha session play out the same way, including the trickster episode, god tier attainment, Casey\u2019s skeleton army, and Her Imperious Condescension springing her psychic trap on Jade and Jane.\nAmong other tidbits, Vriska learns that a replacement John, Roxy, and planet Lowas will show up.

First they put Grimbark Jade to sleep when she came to meet them. Then they mounted a raid on Derse. They rescued Jake, zonked Battermaid Jane, and lost Roxy in battle.\nJade and Jane related these events to Callie in a dream. Their dream continues in this Act as Vriska keeps them asleep and out of Condy\u2019s reach.\nWith the Witch of Space incapacitated, someone else needs to bring planet Earth back to the Medium. Vriska and Terezi come up with a modified magic eight ball fetch modus with features of Dad Egbert\u2019s wallet.

At the time, readers assumed that he would fast-forward to the cherub egg on dead Earth C once he had tired of messing with the alpha kids\u2019 session.\nKanaya chainsawed that theory in half when the session failed to produce a Universe C. Gamzee would have to reach the egg from a different timeline.\nAnother chance for the kids to win the game is another chance for Gamzee to reach the egg. But this time, Gamzee is not on the meteor and does not go to Earth. Vriska has him locked up in Jane\u2019s hunger trunk. Unconcerned for his health, she believes he has \u201cplot armor.\u201d He doesn\u2019t. In the upcoming boss fight, he remains trapped in the fridge until he is consumed by a black hole.\nThus we will have Gamzee apparently dying in this timeline, just as in the doomed timeline, before he can go to raise the cherubim in a new universe and follow Caliborn into his session. This reopens the puzzle: which version of Gamzee is the one who gets there?\nWe may speculate that maybe Gamzee has a secret supply of extra lives, or maybe the cherub acolyte version of him comes from a secret second game-winning timeline. There are many such possibilities, but the text doesn\u2019t give us direct evidence of one over another, so the riddle remains unsettled. Gamzee is a notorious wildcard. His actions are a mystery even to the Author."], ["LILYPAP", "Following the raid, the crew bring Jake, Tavrosprite, Arquiusprite, the locked-up Gamzee, and the two sleeping girls with them to the lilypad platform orbiting Skaia.

It\u2019s the payoff for all the years they spent apart.\nKarkat assures John he has gotten over the old caliginous crush that John could not reciprocate. Dave and John contemplate the fluidity of human experience and the possibility of doing troll romance. Karkat diagnoses John with pitch feelings for Terezi.\nRose and Roxy bond by comparing their cross-scratch selves. They both fell prey to alcoholism, now recovered with help from their friends, while seeking to feel a connection to their long-gone mothers. Dave and Roxy grill each others\u2019 asses, lightning round style. Dave commits increasingly mortifying Freudian pratfalls referring to Roxy and Jane as hot moms.\nJake asks Tavrosprite for a pretend conversation that becomes real. Tavros flatters Jake to boost his self-esteem. Vriska deflates them both with cruel scorn. John gives more substantial encouragement, helping Jake see that he is still growing up and learning about him self.\nTerezi and Vriska give thanks for being friends and teammates again. Terezi worries she might waste the chance at life that her doomed self gave her once Vriska leaves. Kanaya and Vriska pry into each other\u2019s quadrant business.

Kanaya judges that Vriska doesn\u2019t have the capacity for sustained hearts or spades.\nWhen John and Roxy brought Lowas with them from the firefly nothingspace, everything on Lowas came along. Jaspersprite finds empty sprites in the session, digs up the freshly buried Rose body, and prototypes Roxy\u2019s sprite with it. He brings the new Rosesprite to the frog stage to meet the girls.

They will have to fight battles on four fronts with the Condesce, The Felt, the dogs, and the non-dog Jacks.\nMost threatening is Condy, who still plots to continue her reign in the new universe. She must be killed or distracted before she can mindjack anyone powerful. Roxy, Rose, and John volunteer to take the fight to the sea witch. Kanaya will join them after her errand with Echidna, who has asked to see her and Karkat about releasing the Genesis tadpole.\nNext is so-called Lord Jack, the chucklevoodooed Archagent, who is moved by nothing but berzerk rage. Dave and Terezi volunteer to face him. Dirk is expected to join them when he arrives.\nNext, Spades Slick, who Vriska calls Robo Jack for his cool prosthetics, and whose motive is unknown. Slick and his posse, The Felt, barely register as a threat, so Jake is landed with them.\nFinally, Bec Noir is even stronger than the Condesce as long as he wears a Ring of Orbs Fourfold. But Vriska is counting on the Prospitian Monarch with the other ring to keep this Jack stalemated until he can be dealt with. If Jade wakes up, she will be sent to subdue the chess dogs. She is the only player who can. She shares their First Guardian powers, and their Bec nature will not let them kill her.\nJane will be on medic duty when she is deprogrammed and awake. She can resurrect each player once. Rosesprite will place Roxy\u2019s window devices around the Medium as a network of portals for Jane to move from battle to battle.\nWhen the fighting is over, the players will shoot their denizens\u2019 grist hoards and Genesis Frog into Skaia, claim the ultimate reward, and make of Earth a new world to settle in their new universe.\nThe briefing wraps up.

She considers Lrd English a more important fight than all the fights in the session.\nSo Vriska departs for the Furthest Ring, possibly never to see Terezi again.\nVriska\u2019s first stop in the dream bubbles is the horsey cliffscape where dead Vriska and Meenah are keeping the juju chest. It disgusts Vriska to see her own ghost happy doing nothing. She seizes the chest and lays into the punk for going soft. Her catty invective smashes her composure and self-esteem.\nMeenah, who has grown listless and uneasy in her intimacy with ghost Vriska, accepts live Vriska\u2019s invitation to resume their mission.

The Muse speaks first to Callie, dispelling her costume. For the first time, we hear the Muse\u2019s story in her own words.\nThe two Calliopes diverged when one enjoyed the comfort of contact with the Alpha kids and the other did not. Nothing distracted this other Calliope from her deadly contest with Caliborn. She proved the stronger and predominated. But she could not win her dead Sburb session like Caliborn could.\nCalliope\u2019s denizen was not Yaldabaoth but Echidna. When the alternative was to languish forever at a dead end, she accepted Echidna\u2019s choice, died, and waited as a ghost to fulfill a definite purpose once the Furthest Ring is navigable. Callie\u2019s arrival is her cue to begin.\nCallie expected the encounter to accomplish something for herself. But its significance is cosmic, not personal.
