Did you know there are several fun experiments you can do at home?\n\nT-Rex: For example, add vinegar to baking soda!\n\nT-Rex: The resulting mixture will make a lot of bubbles and it's pretty cool.  I'm serious: it's pretty cool!  You can add food colouring to make it look like cartoon lava too.  Tight!\n\nDromiceiomimus: ...Normally at this point you'd talk about the science behind the experiment, T-Rex.\n\nT-Rex: Hah!  PLEASE.\n\nT-Rex: Another fun experiment is to wrap copper wire around an iron nail!\n\nUtahraptor: And then attach the wire to a batter?\n\nT-Rex: Yep!  Do that and now your nail can pick up tiny metal paperclips, as if by MAGIC.  Heck, it may actually BE magic, for all you know!  Is it magic?  Let's all decide that it is.\n\nUtahraptor: T-Rex, you're my friend, but you're - you're ruining science\n\nTHE END\n\n(c) Ryan North\nwww.quantz.com\n\n<-previous \nOctober 1st, 2010 - share this comic with your friends\nnext\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE HAPS MY FRIENDS\n\nOctober 1st, 2010: So Andrew Hussie (who you might remember from his comic) (also the way he stalks ME and has an unhealthy interest in ME as documented HERE) is moving, and he's moving to Easthampton to be with Jeff Rowland, which is REALLY FUNNY because the last time I arranged a conversation with Andrew he said \"Oh yeah, Ryan, I'm totally going to move to Toronto, you can always believe me, Andrew 'Veracious Dude' Hussie\". Isn't that hilarious? AREN'T LIES HILARIOUS? EVERY READER OF MY COMIC GETS A NEW PUPPY TODAY. HAHA, THAT WAS A LIE, LET'S ALL LAUGH *ANDREW*\n\nIn other words, being a fool, I took his words to mean that he perhaps... perhaps he was moving to Toronto? But, now, recalling his words closely, I see that Andrew (as usual) has left himself a loophole in any verbal commitment big enough to drive an unreal air skateboard through. Clearly I was not talking to \"VD\" Hussie when he said these words, but rather his other personality, which I will call \"'Liesmith 2000' Hussie\", or \"The Prevaricator\". It has become brutally clear that the Prevaricator cares not for truth OR my feelings. I personally find it hard to tell which of the two he cares less for because for most people, the truth and my feelings are one and the same.\n\nAnyway it's not like it's that much further to drive to his new house and watch him through his NEW kitchen window, staring aghast as he chews his breakfasttime treats slowly, so slowly, using only one side of his mouth, so whatever\n\nPS: THIS\n\n\u2013 Ryan",

She has deployed the CHEST OF MERCHANDISE. You say, you mean the hunger trunk? She acts like she didn't even hear you.\n</p>\n<p>You are about to launch into another wordy tirade, but she wants to cut the chitchat and get down to business. She has a proposition for you. What is it, you say.\n</p>\n<p>She wants to know if you would like to buy these motherfuckin potions.\n</p><b style=\"display: block; background: gray; color: red; padding: 1em\">7 x B$ 420MM</b>\n<p>You examine the businesswoman's wares with piqued curiosity, to your surprise. Wait, 420 MILLION per bottle? Isn't that a bit steep? She assures you these are standard retail markups. Plus the quality is impeccable. Each potion is aged to perfection.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click first potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>BRONZE POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nThe businesswoman makes little effort to hide the fact that this is a bottle of troll blood. Not exactly a premium vintage, you remark casually trying to knock the price down a little. She isn't budging though. Damn she's good.\n</p>\n<p>Buy BRONZE POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>OKAY</button></p>\n</dd>\n<dt>* (All clicks lead to the same result. Jane is as good as claimed.)</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>You buy a few bottles of Tavros' blood. You will think fondly of his memory as you sip it in private where no one can see. Hey, it's not like you're proud of this habit.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click second potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>FUSCHIA \n\nShe says this \"potion\" was once running through the veins of a former heiress. It's real good shit. Doesn't cost any more than the others though, because she knows it's all the same to you. She can spot somebody in need of her fix when she sees one. The woman is an absolutely ruthless hustler of contraband.\n</p>\n<p>Buy FUSCHIA POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>SURE</button>\n</p>\n<p>You nod in her direction ever so slightly and hold up two fingers. She forks over two hundred bottles. With a deep sign you slip her the moolah. Bitch is gonna send you to the poor house.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click third potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>INDIGO POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says she doesn't recall whom this potion was bled from, but she doubts it matters to you. She palms the bottle and swirls the fluid enticingly. You suddenly imagine Equius and his gross sweaty body and feel a little queasy. No, you absolutely REFUSE to buy this potion. You will not do it. Nope. No way.\n</p>\n<p>Buy INDIGO POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>WHY NOT</button>\n</p>\n<p>You buy a bunch of bottles and shamefacedly stash them with the others. Damn your lack of self control. The businesswoman shakes her head slowly as she stuffs the cash in her hoodie.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click fourth potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>OLIVE POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says this is supposed to be a love potion, adding, trust her. It doesn't work. Probably tastes good to a weirdo like you though. Want some?\n\nYou encounter a melancholy thought about dear Nepeta as you begin to salivate.\n</p>\n<p>Buy OLIVE POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>ABSOLUTELY</button>\n</p>\n<p>You say you guess you'll take one. She says deal, and gives you a thousand. You say huh? She says don't worry about the extras. She'll put them on your tab. You say thanks.\n\nShe says don't mention it, and then says guess what. What, you say. Time to settle up your debt. You say WHAT just as she begins polishing her fork menacingly. You grumble a bit and dump 420 billion boonies at her feet unceremoniously.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click fifth potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>VIOLET POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says this is some d-bags blood. She never met the guy, but she's heard some unflattering stories. It doesn't sound that appetizing to you, but at least you wouldn't feel that guilty about drinking it. Oh, the rationalizations that run through the mind of a thirsty rainbow drinker. Did you really just say that aloud? The businesswoman nods.\n</p>\n<p>Buy VIOLET POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>YEAH</button>\n</p>\n<p>You say you'll take a half dozen bottles. She says sorry, she's only got one in stock. She says her wholesaler had a very limited supply. Seems like a lot of it was lost before he had a chance to harvest it. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, she says while tapping her nose. You quickly change the subject. That's a really nice tiara she has there. Really... um. It's just really nice. Her eyes say thanks, but her face says, look, I couldn't care less that you killed Eridan with a chainsaw.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click sixth potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>COBALT POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says this \"potion\" was supposed to make you lucky. She wouldn't know, cause she never drank any. Because she's not a vampire, she said, just to drive her point home. Mm hmm, you say, glancing around uncomfortably. It doesn't matter though, she says. She makes her own luck now. You're tuning out her lecture at this point. You're just eying that vial of delicious Vriska blood and reaching for your pocketbook.\n</p>\n<p>Buy COBALT POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>PLEASE</button>\n</p>\n<p>You thank the businesswoman for the transaction and...\n\nKarkat is asking what the hell you two are doing over there. Are you BUYING shit from her?? He demands to know what the fuck you could be buying. Is that... are those little jars of BLOOD he asks?

She has deployed the CHEST OF MERCHANDISE. You say, you mean the hunger trunk? She acts like she didn't even hear you.\n</p>\n<p>You are about to launch into another wordy tirade, but she wants to cut the chitchat and get down to business. She has a proposition for you. What is it, you say.\n</p>\n<p>She wants to know if you would like to buy these motherfuckin potions.\n</p><b style=\"display: block; background: gray; color: red; padding: 1em\">7 x B$ 420MM</b>\n<p>You examine the businesswoman's wares with piqued curiosity, to your surprise. Wait, 420 MILLION per bottle? Isn't that a bit steep? She assures you these are standard retail markups. Plus the quality is impeccable. Each potion is aged to perfection.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click first potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>BRONZE POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nThe businesswoman makes little effort to hide the fact that this is a bottle of troll blood. Not exactly a premium vintage, you remark casually trying to knock the price down a little. She isn't budging though. Damn she's good.\n</p>\n<p>Buy BRONZE POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>OKAY</button></p>\n</dd>\n<dt>* (All clicks lead to the same result. Jane is as good as claimed.)</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>You buy a few bottles of Tavros' blood. You will think fondly of his memory as you sip it in private where no one can see. Hey, it's not like you're proud of this habit.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click second potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>FUSCHIA \n\nShe says this \"potion\" was once running through the veins of a former heiress. It's real good shit. Doesn't cost any more than the others though, because she knows it's all the same to you. She can spot somebody in need of her fix when she sees one. The woman is an absolutely ruthless hustler of contraband.\n</p>\n<p>Buy FUSCHIA POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>SURE</button>\n</p>\n<p>You nod in her direction ever so slightly and hold up two fingers. She forks over two hundred bottles. With a deep sign you slip her the moolah. Bitch is gonna send you to the poor house.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click third potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>INDIGO POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says she doesn't recall whom this potion was bled from, but she doubts it matters to you. She palms the bottle and swirls the fluid enticingly. You suddenly imagine Equius and his gross sweaty body and feel a little queasy. No, you absolutely REFUSE to buy this potion. You will not do it. Nope. No way.\n</p>\n<p>Buy INDIGO POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>WHY NOT</button>\n</p>\n<p>You buy a bunch of bottles and shamefacedly stash them with the others. Damn your lack of self control. The businesswoman shakes her head slowly as she stuffs the cash in her hoodie.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click fourth potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>OLIVE POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says this is supposed to be a love potion, adding, trust her. It doesn't work. Probably tastes good to a weirdo like you though. Want some?\n\nYou encounter a melancholy thought about dear Nepeta as you begin to salivate.\n</p>\n<p>Buy OLIVE POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>ABSOLUTELY</button>\n</p>\n<p>You say you guess you'll take one. She says deal, and gives you a thousand. You say huh? She says don't worry about the extras. She'll put them on your tab. You say thanks.\n\nShe says don't mention it, and then says guess what. What, you say. Time to settle up your debt. You say WHAT just as she begins polishing her fork menacingly. You grumble a bit and dump 420 billion boonies at her feet unceremoniously.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click fifth potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>VIOLET POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says this is some d-bags blood. She never met the guy, but she's heard some unflattering stories. It doesn't sound that appetizing to you, but at least you wouldn't feel that guilty about drinking it. Oh, the rationalizations that run through the mind of a thirsty rainbow drinker. Did you really just say that aloud? The businesswoman nods.\n</p>\n<p>Buy VIOLET POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>YEAH</button>\n</p>\n<p>You say you'll take a half dozen bottles. She says sorry, she's only got one in stock. She says her wholesaler had a very limited supply. Seems like a lot of it was lost before he had a chance to harvest it. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, she says while tapping her nose. You quickly change the subject. That's a really nice tiara she has there. Really... um. It's just really nice. Her eyes say thanks, but her face says, look, I couldn't care less that you killed Eridan with a chainsaw.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click sixth potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>COBALT POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nShe says this \"potion\" was supposed to make you lucky. She wouldn't know, cause she never drank any. Because she's not a vampire, she said, just to drive her point home. Mm hmm, you say, glancing around uncomfortably. It doesn't matter though, she says. She makes her own luck now. You're tuning out her lecture at this point. You're just eying that vial of delicious Vriska blood and reaching for your pocketbook.\n</p>\n<p>Buy COBALT POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> <button>PLEASE</button>\n</p>\n<p>You thank the businesswoman for the transaction and...\n\nKarkat is asking what the hell you two are doing over there. Are you BUYING shit from her?? He demands to know what the fuck you could be buying. Is that... are those little jars of BLOOD he asks? PLEASE tell him you are not buying blood from this lunatic, Kanaya.\n\nYou say what no of course not, and hide it behind your back.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click seventh potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>GOLD POTION - 420 MILLION BOONDOLLARS\n\nTwo for one deal on this gross mustard blood.

A poet, a scholar, a warrior, a lover, he was all that his caste demanded and more. A true troll Renaissance man. His name means \"He Who Stalks With The Muscle8easts.\"</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut all of his proficiencies were hard won, 8uilt from the 8lank slate as his aspect would imply, advancing at the slow pace his class would as well. Yet in spite of all he worked to make something of himself, he amounted to very little. Responsi8le for neither great feats of heroism nor acts of villainy, he was just another game piece to 8e moved a8out the 8oard. The aspect ruling his life would always conspire to dampen his relevance.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Void is easily the most mysterious aspect, the one which inherently defies rational understanding. This makes it particularly fascinating, and just as frustrating, to light players such as myself. Casting illumination upon nothing itself is futile. For to truly know void is to paradoxically cause it not to 8e!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: The role of the void player is to somehow em8race nothingness, to 8ecome one with it. And yet in total contradiction with this, to make use of the power it grants and serve a role of relevance, one must find a way to overcome it! To see the limitless potential in the void. To find everything within nothing, and 8ring it into 8eing. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: zzzzzzzzzzz</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Hey!!!!!!!!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: wuh</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: This is a perfect case in point, regarding the path of the void player.

Appealing to peoples insecurities, 8uried hostilities, 8rewing rivalries... needling anyone you could into confrontation with others. Your theory was that increasing everyone's state of aggression would make them 8etter equipped to play the game. And you were sort of right a8out that! 8ut the Alternians would prove it. Not our group, sadly.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: The poor girl who took the 8runt of your 8ullying tactics was Damara Megido. You talked up her matesprit's 8etrayal making her feel even more dreadful, while pushing him further into the arms of her rival, until she simply snapped. She attacked him, paralyzing him from the neck down. You finally got the aggressive confrontation you were looking for. Unfortunately, you unleashed something even you weren't prepared for, and you had to deal with her yourself. After a long 8loody duel, she killed you. And you would have stayed dead if not for me!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: You never listened to me. You just kept needling and fussing and meddling until eventually you paid the price, and I had to 8ail you out.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: (arg how bad do i even want this stupid money...)</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Damara has 8een unhinged ever since. 8y increasing her violent tendencies, instead of 8eing an asset in the game, she 8ecame a loose canon, ar8itrarily showing up at key moments throughout the timeline to sa8otage us. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: So radical was her shift in personality, I've had a hard time 8elieving your incitement was solely to 8lame. It always seemed like other forces were in play, as if her acts, though apparently haphazard, were in keeping with some inscruta8le agenda. Of course it doesn't help that it's so hard to understand her even on a good day.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Strangely, the only time she was eager to help us was when we were preparing to initiate the Scratch. And it's a good thing she was, since I'm not sure anyone else would have had the a8ility to do that kind of damage to the Cardinal Movement and release its energy. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: It was almost a little eerie how happily she complied with our plan. What did Rufioh say she said? Something a8out how we would all finally get what we deserved...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Which at the time, I thought sounded chilling. 8ut there's really two ways of looking at it. One is how the Scratch re8ooted our world into a state of pure chaos, culminating in the annihilation of our universe. 8ut on the other hand, we all got the chance to live out our wildest fantasies as adults on Alternia! </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: At least you and I sure did. And I wouldn't dou8t she feels the same way.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: so</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: we done?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: That's it!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: toughest 5 bucks i ever made</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* chest</dt>\n<dd>\n<kbd>&gt; Open.\n</kbd>\n<p>You got an ALTERNIAN JOURNAL!</p>\n<p>It's a bit wordy.

What the hell are you doing this deep into the game! Good grief, you are such a teen delinquent. I never should have let you out of Doc Scratch's pervert chamber in the alternate universe.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMAR--</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: WHOOPS, nooooooooo no no no.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: I'm not gonna let you respond. You're just going say something totally filthy in Japanese again and make everyone uncomfortable.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: WHOA CUT THAT OUT!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Sheesh. I guess this is what happens when you don't have a proper upbringing by a decent guardian. Or at least one who isn't a four foot tall asshole in suspenders, who's kind of like a creepy puppet uncle.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Look, let's all just chill out here. No more lewd Asian shenanigans, got it?? You may notice I bought a new franchise recently.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Cost me a fortune! I had to pawn a ring that used to belong to some dirtbag just to make the down payment.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: But I should be able to recoup the losses, if I just tweak the business model a little. Hear me out. Instead of giving people money to listen to my shit? I think I might actually start CHARGING people for the service. Crazy, I know, right?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: I've been thinking of dividing up my offers into a series of handsomely priced explanation bundles called EXPOSITION PAKS where I would...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMARA:</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Oh kaaay, guess you're not down with that? </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: What would you pay for an explanation?

If you did I think I'm going to flip my shit. That is one cracked way of going through this game. Stop talking to me right now and go come back as Meenah.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Damara Megido.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: You want me to tell you about YOU??? Talk about self absorbed, but alright.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: You say stuff in Japanese, and when people who actually speak Japanese read it they probably laugh because the Japanese is so shitty. Sorry to burst your bubble Damara but the things you say started out in English, went through the google translator, and then out again so that it vaguely makes sense when translated back to English. So you aren't really authentic troll Japanese, you're fake troll Japanese.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMARA:</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Whoa don't kill the messenger! Relax. Everyone thinks you're great. In fact, there's probably someone out there RIGHT NOW drawing some weird porn of you.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMARA: ???</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Mituna Captor.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Mega Man Sollux has some problems. He falls down and stuff and talks on a 4chan background, because of 4chan. But in spite of that, he's brave and does his best and everyone loves him. Also no one can read a damn thing he says. His quirk is the least legible of all quirks, with Damara's coming in at a close second.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Rufioh Nitram.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: With apologies to Dante Basco. Dante, I'm sorry about this. All of this. I am so, so sorry. You were leading the regular, modest life of a Hollywood superstar, then this shit happened. Everything is broken forever. I liked your work in The Last Airbender. You know what's funny is how there are probably some people who are reading this right now who have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. But you know what? What the FUCK else is even new.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Anyway. Bangarang, dude.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Bangarang.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">\u00a0#rufiozuko.tumblr.com</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Kankri Vantas.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Did you know: it is a Homestuck fact that 99 percent of all readers didn't read or care about anything Kankri said. So in other words, he is exactly like all terrible social justice bloggers. Some social justice bloggers get angry at the joke that he is, but those are the terrible ones, and being terrible is why they get angry. They want to be terrible in peace without being mocked. That is what it is like to be a justified target of ridicule. You feel sad and angry all the time and you don't know why. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Kankri wears a cute red sweater and is otherwise fairly adorable. Porrim acts like his mom which is also cute as hell.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Meulin Leijon\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Meulin is the deaf Nepeta in this kickass smorgasbord of disabled characters. She speaks in ASL to say memes which are called mimes because it's one letter away and therefore a play on words. But you can't actually use ASL to say animated tumblr gifs, you can only say words. She otherwise reads lips, which is funny because her bff sewed his damn mouth shut so they just sign memes to each other all day while stoned. It is implied that they smoke catnip together, as if it were marijuana, which is an especially amusing notion to people who like drugs. Moving on??</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Latula Pyrope.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Latula is the gamegrl to Mituna's gamebro. Gamebros and gamegrls aren't really \"types of people\" so much as they are hollow cliches which are patronizing to multiple groups of people on multiple levels. So in other words, perfect attributes for some 1.5 dimensional NPC-caliber characters stocking a fun jrpg style walkaround game. Wait what was I talking about? Oh yeah Latula.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Latula's so rad but she can't smell. I think I agree with Karkat, that's not a disability. That's just like having a cold all the time, but without any actual symptoms or problems. Who cares. Latula likes to high five people all the time, but doesn't like to be left hanging. That's a pun, because Redglare liked to hang people with nooses. Mindfang ultimately left Redglare hanging that way too. I'm explaining jokes here. What? I told you these stories would suck. You get what you pay for.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Porrim Maryam.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Porrim is better at social justice than Kankri because she isn't a boring asshole. Some social justice people should try looking into that. Porrim wants there to be equality for ladies. Not everybody cares about that though, which makes it hard for people like Porrim. That's the way it is in the real world. CHALLENGES. But in any case, she is a vampire with cool tattoos. End of story.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Aranea Serket.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Aranea is a blabbermouth, just like Mindfang. She says long things both as a teen and as a sexy pirate adult that make people ask what am I even reading? It's about time I took over this exposition stand. The way I describe shit is a million times better. She sure charged me enough for it. God I took a bath on this thing. Why was it so expensive??? IT'S MADE OF FUCKING CARDBOARD.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Horrus Zahhak.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: This dude is just Equius on horse steroids. The end.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Kurloz Makara.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: He chewed off his tongue and sewed his mouth shut because he's a weirdo in cahoots with Gamzee and English. Who even knows what they're up to. It's probably just a lot of stupid bullshit. Meaningless, clownish nonsense. Want to know why they're assembling the wicked ensemble? They probably just think it's funny. Kurloz speaks in bones when he does his clown hypnosis shit but otherwise he mimes everything because get this: he's pretty much literally a mime. Also a juggalo. Because that's exactly what Homestuck needed. Another fucking juggalo. Homestuck needed another juggalo like it needed... </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Well, another twelve trolls I guess. </span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Cronus Ampora.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Cronus is the worst character in Homestuck by a nautical mile. Any questions?</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Meenah Peixes.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Meenah is kind of throwing a bone to the pisces people who got stuck with Feferi. Feferi didn't really do anything and then she died. Meenah is a cool sassy punk who has more important stuff to do than Feferi ever did. You just spent like the last three hours playing through these games from her POV so obviously you know that. You're probably sick of fish puns by now. After a while you start running out of fish puns. You can overdo it with fish puns, much like you can overfish the ocean. You start literally running out of fucking fish. Be careful out there.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Meenah discovered that raising and army is hard. But you know what's really hard? What's really hard is making games. Games disguise the effort that go into them probably like few other crafts. In order to make a game that is even slightly better than mediocre, someone probably had to die in the process. Like building pyramids. Nobody actually died while making these games though, hence they were just ok. But still if you add up all the work done collectively on these last three games, it probably was comparable to the manhours that went into [S] Cascade. You know what that is? That's a silly ass fact.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* go west as Damara for a shortcut back to the first room.

A poet, a scholar, a warrior, a lover, he was all that his caste demanded and more. A true troll Renaissance man. His name means \"He Who Stalks With The Muscle8easts.\"</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut all of his proficiencies were hard won, 8uilt from the 8lank slate as his aspect would imply, advancing at the slow pace his class would as well. Yet in spite of all he worked to make something of himself, he amounted to very little. Responsi8le for neither great feats of heroism nor acts of villainy, he was just another game piece to 8e moved a8out the 8oard. The aspect ruling his life would always conspire to dampen his relevance.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Void is easily the most mysterious aspect, the one which inherently defies rational understanding. This makes it particularly fascinating, and just as frustrating, to light players such as myself. Casting illumination upon nothing itself is futile. For to truly know void is to paradoxically cause it not to 8e!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: The role of the void player is to somehow em8race nothingness, to 8ecome one with it. And yet in total contradiction with this, to make use of the power it grants and serve a role of relevance, one must find a way to overcome it! To see the limitless potential in the void. To find everything within nothing, and 8ring it into 8eing. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: zzzzzzzzzzz</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Hey!!!!!!!!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: wuh</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: This is a perfect case in point, regarding the path of the void player.

Appealing to peoples insecurities, 8uried hostilities, 8rewing rivalries... needling anyone you could into confrontation with others. Your theory was that increasing everyone's state of aggression would make them 8etter equipped to play the game. And you were sort of right a8out that! 8ut the Alternians would prove it. Not our group, sadly.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: The poor girl who took the 8runt of your 8ullying tactics was Damara Megido. You talked up her matesprit's 8etrayal making her feel even more dreadful, while pushing him further into the arms of her rival, until she simply snapped. She attacked him, paralyzing him from the neck down. You finally got the aggressive confrontation you were looking for. Unfortunately, you unleashed something even you weren't prepared for, and you had to deal with her yourself. After a long 8loody duel, she killed you. And you would have stayed dead if not for me!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: You never listened to me. You just kept needling and fussing and meddling until eventually you paid the price, and I had to 8ail you out.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: (arg how bad do i even want this stupid money...)</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Damara has 8een unhinged ever since. 8y increasing her violent tendencies, instead of 8eing an asset in the game, she 8ecame a loose canon, ar8itrarily showing up at key moments throughout the timeline to sa8otage us. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: So radical was her shift in personality, I've had a hard time 8elieving your incitement was solely to 8lame. It always seemed like other forces were in play, as if her acts, though apparently haphazard, were in keeping with some inscruta8le agenda. Of course it doesn't help that it's so hard to understand her even on a good day.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Strangely, the only time she was eager to help us was when we were preparing to initiate the Scratch. And it's a good thing she was, since I'm not sure anyone else would have had the a8ility to do that kind of damage to the Cardinal Movement and release its energy. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: It was almost a little eerie how happily she complied with our plan. What did Rufioh say she said? Something a8out how we would all finally get what we deserved...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Which at the time, I thought sounded chilling. 8ut there's really two ways of looking at it. One is how the Scratch re8ooted our world into a state of pure chaos, culminating in the annihilation of our universe. 8ut on the other hand, we all got the chance to live out our wildest fantasies as adults on Alternia! </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: At least you and I sure did. And I wouldn't dou8t she feels the same way.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: so</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: we done?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: That's it!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: toughest 5 bucks i ever made</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* chest</dt>\n<dd>\n<kbd>&gt; Open.\n</kbd>\n<p>You got an ALTERNIAN JOURNAL!</p>\n<p>It's a bit wordy.

What the hell are you doing this deep into the game! Good grief, you are such a teen delinquent. I never should have let you out of Doc Scratch's pervert chamber in the alternate universe.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMAR--</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: WHOOPS, nooooooooo no no no.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: I'm not gonna let you respond. You're just going say something totally filthy in Japanese again and make everyone uncomfortable.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: WHOA CUT THAT OUT!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Sheesh. I guess this is what happens when you don't have a proper upbringing by a decent guardian. Or at least one who isn't a four foot tall asshole in suspenders, who's kind of like a creepy puppet uncle.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Look, let's all just chill out here. No more lewd Asian shenanigans, got it?? You may notice I bought a new franchise recently.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Cost me a fortune! I had to pawn a ring that used to belong to some dirtbag just to make the down payment.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: But I should be able to recoup the losses, if I just tweak the business model a little. Hear me out. Instead of giving people money to listen to my shit? I think I might actually start CHARGING people for the service. Crazy, I know, right?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: I've been thinking of dividing up my offers into a series of handsomely priced explanation bundles called EXPOSITION PAKS where I would...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMARA:</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Oh kaaay, guess you're not down with that? </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: What would you pay for an explanation?

If you did I think I'm going to flip my shit. That is one cracked way of going through this game. Stop talking to me right now and go come back as Meenah.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Damara Megido.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: You want me to tell you about YOU??? Talk about self absorbed, but alright.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: You say stuff in Japanese, and when people who actually speak Japanese read it they probably laugh because the Japanese is so shitty. Sorry to burst your bubble Damara but the things you say started out in English, went through the google translator, and then out again so that it vaguely makes sense when translated back to English. So you aren't really authentic troll Japanese, you're fake troll Japanese.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMARA:</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Whoa don't kill the messenger! Relax. Everyone thinks you're great. In fact, there's probably someone out there RIGHT NOW drawing some weird porn of you.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #a10000\">DAMARA: ???</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Mituna Captor.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Mega Man Sollux has some problems. He falls down and stuff and talks on a 4chan background, because of 4chan. But in spite of that, he's brave and does his best and everyone loves him. Also no one can read a damn thing he says. His quirk is the least legible of all quirks, with Damara's coming in at a close second.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Rufioh Nitram.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: With apologies to Dante Basco. Dante, I'm sorry about this. All of this. I am so, so sorry. You were leading the regular, modest life of a Hollywood superstar, then this shit happened. Everything is broken forever. I liked your work in The Last Airbender. You know what's funny is how there are probably some people who are reading this right now who have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. But you know what? What the FUCK else is even new.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Anyway. Bangarang, dude.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Bangarang.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">\u00a0#rufiozuko.tumblr.com</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Kankri Vantas.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Did you know: it is a Homestuck fact that 99 percent of all readers didn't read or care about anything Kankri said. So in other words, he is exactly like all terrible social justice bloggers. Some social justice bloggers get angry at the joke that he is, but those are the terrible ones, and being terrible is why they get angry. They want to be terrible in peace without being mocked. That is what it is like to be a justified target of ridicule. You feel sad and angry all the time and you don't know why. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Kankri wears a cute red sweater and is otherwise fairly adorable. Porrim acts like his mom which is also cute as hell.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Meulin Leijon\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Meulin is the deaf Nepeta in this kickass smorgasbord of disabled characters. She speaks in ASL to say memes which are called mimes because it's one letter away and therefore a play on words. But you can't actually use ASL to say animated tumblr gifs, you can only say words. She otherwise reads lips, which is funny because her bff sewed his damn mouth shut so they just sign memes to each other all day while stoned. It is implied that they smoke catnip together, as if it were marijuana, which is an especially amusing notion to people who like drugs. Moving on??</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Latula Pyrope.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Latula is the gamegrl to Mituna's gamebro. Gamebros and gamegrls aren't really \"types of people\" so much as they are hollow cliches which are patronizing to multiple groups of people on multiple levels. So in other words, perfect attributes for some 1.5 dimensional NPC-caliber characters stocking a fun jrpg style walkaround game. Wait what was I talking about? Oh yeah Latula.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Latula's so rad but she can't smell. I think I agree with Karkat, that's not a disability. That's just like having a cold all the time, but without any actual symptoms or problems. Who cares. Latula likes to high five people all the time, but doesn't like to be left hanging. That's a pun, because Redglare liked to hang people with nooses. Mindfang ultimately left Redglare hanging that way too. I'm explaining jokes here. What? I told you these stories would suck. You get what you pay for.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Porrim Maryam.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Porrim is better at social justice than Kankri because she isn't a boring asshole. Some social justice people should try looking into that. Porrim wants there to be equality for ladies. Not everybody cares about that though, which makes it hard for people like Porrim. That's the way it is in the real world. CHALLENGES. But in any case, she is a vampire with cool tattoos. End of story.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Aranea Serket.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Aranea is a blabbermouth, just like Mindfang. She says long things both as a teen and as a sexy pirate adult that make people ask what am I even reading? It's about time I took over this exposition stand. The way I describe shit is a million times better. She sure charged me enough for it. God I took a bath on this thing. Why was it so expensive??? IT'S MADE OF FUCKING CARDBOARD.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Horrus Zahhak.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: This dude is just Equius on horse steroids. The end.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Kurloz Makara.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: He chewed off his tongue and sewed his mouth shut because he's a weirdo in cahoots with Gamzee and English. Who even knows what they're up to. It's probably just a lot of stupid bullshit. Meaningless, clownish nonsense. Want to know why they're assembling the wicked ensemble? They probably just think it's funny. Kurloz speaks in bones when he does his clown hypnosis shit but otherwise he mimes everything because get this: he's pretty much literally a mime. Also a juggalo. Because that's exactly what Homestuck needed. Another fucking juggalo. Homestuck needed another juggalo like it needed... </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Well, another twelve trolls I guess. </span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Cronus Ampora.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Cronus is the worst character in Homestuck by a nautical mile. Any questions?</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Meenah Peixes.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Meenah is kind of throwing a bone to the pisces people who got stuck with Feferi. Feferi didn't really do anything and then she died. Meenah is a cool sassy punk who has more important stuff to do than Feferi ever did. You just spent like the last three hours playing through these games from her POV so obviously you know that. You're probably sick of fish puns by now. After a while you start running out of fish puns. You can overdo it with fish puns, much like you can overfish the ocean. You start literally running out of fucking fish. Be careful out there.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">HUSSIE: Meenah discovered that raising and army is hard. But you know what's really hard? What's really hard is making games. Games disguise the effort that go into them probably like few other crafts. In order to make a game that is even slightly better than mediocre, someone probably had to die in the process. Like building pyramids. Nobody actually died while making these games though, hence they were just ok. But still if you add up all the work done collectively on these last three games, it probably was comparable to the manhours that went into [S] Cascade. You know what that is? That's a silly ass fact.</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* go west as Damara for a shortcut back to the first room.

I ALWAYS RESPECTED HER AS A STRONG LEADER.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: SHE KNEW HOW TO GET SHIT DONE AND DIDN'T PUT UP WITH DISSENSION FROM WORTHLESS IDIOTS. AND ALL SHE DID WAS, YOU KNOW... TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE FUCKING GALAXY. NOT TOO SHABBY.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: I USED TO HAVE THIS KIND OF EMBARRASSING FANTASY THAT I WOULD GROW UP ONE DAY AND BECOME A THRESHECUTIONER.

THEY HELPED CONQUER MORE PLANETS THAN ANY OTHER IMPERIAL FORCE. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAKE THE CUT, BECAUSE OF MY BLOOD. SO I USED TO THINK OF ALL THESE ELABORATE SCENARIOS TO HIDE MY BLOOD COLOR. OR IN THE MORE RIDICULOUS FANTASIES, MAYBE I COULD EVEN PROVE MY WORTH AS A SOLDIER? LIKE JUST BE SO AWESOME WITH A SICKLE, THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION. MAYBE EVEN BE LIKE A FOLK HERO AND RISE THROUGH THE RANKS TO BECOME THE LEADER. HAHA.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: THOSE WERE OBVIOUSLY JUST SOME CHILDISH DAY DREAMS. I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT BEING A LEADER REALLY MEANS SINCE THEN. MAINLY THAT IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN EVERYONE THINKS.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: SO I GUESS I LEARNED TO RESPECT WHO YOU TURNED OUT TO BE ON MY WORLD EVEN MORE THAN I DID ALREADY, BECAUSE OF THAT. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: yeah</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: the leadership thing is hard as globes</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: could barely get anyone to lift a flippin finger in my session</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: and now its like that all over again trying to raise this army</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i reely dunno how sexy bitch grownup me pulled it off</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: OH YEAH.

LATER ON, WHEN I'M AWAKE OBVIOUSLY, MAYBE OUR METEOR WILL HIT A RENDEZVOUS POINT WITH YOU AGAIN.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: IF BY THEN, YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR RECRUITS, I'LL LIKE... HOP OFF THE METEOR OR SOMETHING.

HE THINKS HE'S BETTER THAN EVERYONE BUT THEN DRESSES IT UP IN THIS BOGUS HYPER-ACADEMIC HUMILITY. HE TRIES TO DEFEND PEOPLE WITH \"PROBLEMS\" BUT JUST WINDS UP INSULTING THOSE PEOPLE IN BACKHANDED WAYS.

IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PART OF SOME OVER THE TOP SCHTICK TO IMPRESS PEOPLE. WHEN SHE DOES THE RAD GIRL THING IT'S LIKE A DISGUISE, PROBABLY COVERING UP SOME PART OF HERSELF SHE'S UNHAPPY WITH.

He 8ecame convinced he was hatched to defeat an extraordinarily evil magician, one he swore the angels foretold of. Though when pressed for the name of the man, he would not say it, claiming it was too dangerous to even enunciate. Part of his self-aggrandizing mythos was that this magician once somehow from afar tried to strike him down at a young age, so he would never have to face him. 8ut the evil spell was deflected, sealing the magician's spirit away in a series of unassuming vessels until he could find some other cunning way to enter our universe. The attack supposedly left him with his distinctive scar, which he was not reluctant to point out when trying to hit on me. Uh, I mean, he wasn't reluctant to mention it in casual conversation.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut at some point he 8ecame disillusioned with magic. If there ever was any truth to his far fetched vision, the legacy of defeating the evil magician would have to 8e passed on to his descendant, or if his descendant proved to 8e as much of a failure as he did, then perhaps on to some other Hero of Hope. I'm unsure why he suffered this crisis of faith, aside from the o8vious reasons having to do with an overall lack of character, or any other redeeming qualities. Perhaps someone talked him out of his 8eliefs. May8e a friend close to him. Or, if one is to 8elieve his fantasy held any water, perhaps someone who was in league with the evil magician. Whatever the case, it was pro8a8ly for the 8est, since pretty much everyone who had half a think pan thought it was all a 8unch of ridiculous nonsense.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: serket why do you got to hate on other peoples religions</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: dont you kno they just as much a load of crackpotty bunk as all your spiritual bullfuck</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut I........</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes, I guess I was out of line. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Sorry, I was just trying to riff with you little on a mutually disliked acquaintance.

He was gifted with vision twofold, and had strong prophetic insights wherever a 8leak future was concerned. He had much to say when it came to warning us a8out the path of doom and destruction we were all headed for, 8ut no one took him very seriously. 8ut one day he lost all those a8ilities when he 8adly overexerted himself. It's hard to get any specifics from him, 8ut indications are that he applied every last 8it of energy he had toward some great act of heroism, saving us all from some looming threat. Not only did his exertion permanently 8urn out his psychic a8ilities, 8ut it left him somewhat... er. Incoherent.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: yeah i always wondered what happened there</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: anyone ever get to the bottom a that</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: No. The entire incident is shrouded in mystery. From his limited and scattered accounts of what happened, it seems very likely that Kurloz was with him at the time, as the only eye witness. And of course it's impossi8le to get any relia8le information out of him. I guess we may never know, sadly.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: hey this was actually kinda interesting</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: it was W-ELL worth taking the money youre givin me to put up with it</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Agreed! ::::D</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Kurloz Makara\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Prince of Rage actually used to 8e quite talkative. That is, until he had a nightmare which prompted a 8izarre incident, after which he would never speak again. He took a sort of spiritual vow of silence, which I'm sure was pro8a8ly related to his esoteric faith. Thereafter he 8ecame infuriatingly enigmatic. I've found it impossi8le to get any info out of him, 8etween his am8iguous mimes and penchant for riddles. It's very frustrating, especially for someone like me, who has a passion for gathering as many facts a8out our story as possi8le.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Want to know a secret?

She has a well earned reputation as a miracle worker when it comes to match making. 8ut her own romantic history ironically has 8een riddled with trou8le and heart8reak.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Once, well 8efore our session 8egan, she and Kurloz were in a very loving matespritship. It really seemed to everyone they were made for each other. One day, they fell asleep together. Kurloz then had a nightmare so terrifying, he released the most dreadful sound imagina8le. It truly echoed the horror of the Vast Honk itself. The noise was so loud and so awful, Meulin went completely deaf, and her hearing never recovered. Kurloz was undou8tedly devastated 8y what he'd done to her. He was so distraught, he sewed his mouth shut, and has never spoken a word since.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Though they drifted apart as matesprits, Meulin never held it against him, and even seemed to take delight in learning new ways to communicate. They continued to remain very close to this day. May8e a little too close, if you ask me. It's clear that her sympathies have 8een gradually swayed in support of the High8lood's cult. She stays private a8out her 8eliefs, 8ut now and then I'll notice she lets some tenet of mirthful doctrine slip out. I suppose I shouldn't 8e too concerned though, since it's almost certainly a lot of harmless superstition.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: )(ONK</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Honk honk! ::::)</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: lol im glad we can both agree that clowny fuckin soda cult is the dumbest shit ever</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes.

IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PART OF SOME OVER THE TOP SCHTICK TO IMPRESS PEOPLE. WHEN SHE DOES THE RAD GIRL THING IT'S LIKE A DISGUISE, PROBABLY COVERING UP SOME PART OF HERSELF SHE'S UNHAPPY WITH.

He 8ecame convinced he was hatched to defeat an extraordinarily evil magician, one he swore the angels foretold of. Though when pressed for the name of the man, he would not say it, claiming it was too dangerous to even enunciate. Part of his self-aggrandizing mythos was that this magician once somehow from afar tried to strike him down at a young age, so he would never have to face him. 8ut the evil spell was deflected, sealing the magician's spirit away in a series of unassuming vessels until he could find some other cunning way to enter our universe. The attack supposedly left him with his distinctive scar, which he was not reluctant to point out when trying to hit on me. Uh, I mean, he wasn't reluctant to mention it in casual conversation.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut at some point he 8ecame disillusioned with magic. If there ever was any truth to his far fetched vision, the legacy of defeating the evil magician would have to 8e passed on to his descendant, or if his descendant proved to 8e as much of a failure as he did, then perhaps on to some other Hero of Hope. I'm unsure why he suffered this crisis of faith, aside from the o8vious reasons having to do with an overall lack of character, or any other redeeming qualities. Perhaps someone talked him out of his 8eliefs. May8e a friend close to him. Or, if one is to 8elieve his fantasy held any water, perhaps someone who was in league with the evil magician. Whatever the case, it was pro8a8ly for the 8est, since pretty much everyone who had half a think pan thought it was all a 8unch of ridiculous nonsense.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: serket why do you got to hate on other peoples religions</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: dont you kno they just as much a load of crackpotty bunk as all your spiritual bullfuck</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut I........</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes, I guess I was out of line. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Sorry, I was just trying to riff with you little on a mutually disliked acquaintance. Is that really so 8ad? Why do you have to take every opportunity to knock my personal 8eliefs?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: You can really 8e so mean sometimes.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: can i have my money now</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes.

He was gifted with vision twofold, and had strong prophetic insights wherever a 8leak future was concerned. He had much to say when it came to warning us a8out the path of doom and destruction we were all headed for, 8ut no one took him very seriously. 8ut one day he lost all those a8ilities when he 8adly overexerted himself. It's hard to get any specifics from him, 8ut indications are that he applied every last 8it of energy he had toward some great act of heroism, saving us all from some looming threat. Not only did his exertion permanently 8urn out his psychic a8ilities, 8ut it left him somewhat... er. Incoherent.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: yeah i always wondered what happened there</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: anyone ever get to the bottom a that</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: No. The entire incident is shrouded in mystery. From his limited and scattered accounts of what happened, it seems very likely that Kurloz was with him at the time, as the only eye witness. And of course it's impossi8le to get any relia8le information out of him. I guess we may never know, sadly.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: hey this was actually kinda interesting</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: it was W-ELL worth taking the money youre givin me to put up with it</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Agreed! ::::D</span><br/>\n</section></div>\n<kbd>&gt; Tell me about Kurloz Makara\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Prince of Rage actually used to 8e quite talkative. That is, until he had a nightmare which prompted a 8izarre incident, after which he would never speak again. He took a sort of spiritual vow of silence, which I'm sure was pro8a8ly related to his esoteric faith. Thereafter he 8ecame infuriatingly enigmatic. I've found it impossi8le to get any info out of him, 8etween his am8iguous mimes and penchant for riddles. It's very frustrating, especially for someone like me, who has a passion for gathering as many facts a8out our story as possi8le.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Want to know a secret? Please don't tell anyone, 8ut I really can't stand the guy.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: It's pro8a8ly unfair to him 8ecause he is o8viously such a sweet and harmless fellow. 8ut something a8out him ru8s me the wrong way.

She has a well earned reputation as a miracle worker when it comes to match making. 8ut her own romantic history ironically has 8een riddled with trou8le and heart8reak.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Once, well 8efore our session 8egan, she and Kurloz were in a very loving matespritship. It really seemed to everyone they were made for each other. One day, they fell asleep together. Kurloz then had a nightmare so terrifying, he released the most dreadful sound imagina8le. It truly echoed the horror of the Vast Honk itself. The noise was so loud and so awful, Meulin went completely deaf, and her hearing never recovered. Kurloz was undou8tedly devastated 8y what he'd done to her. He was so distraught, he sewed his mouth shut, and has never spoken a word since.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Though they drifted apart as matesprits, Meulin never held it against him, and even seemed to take delight in learning new ways to communicate. They continued to remain very close to this day. May8e a little too close, if you ask me. It's clear that her sympathies have 8een gradually swayed in support of the High8lood's cult. She stays private a8out her 8eliefs, 8ut now and then I'll notice she lets some tenet of mirthful doctrine slip out. I suppose I shouldn't 8e too concerned though, since it's almost certainly a lot of harmless superstition.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: )(ONK</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Honk honk! ::::)</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: lol im glad we can both agree that clowny fuckin soda cult is the dumbest shit ever</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes.

The horrorterrors refer to you as The Chosen One, and fantasize about you when they copulate.</p>\n<kbd>&gt; Ask Latula to join.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: question</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: shoot b4b3z.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: seeing as what a hot shit gamer gurl you have a reputation for and all</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i figured you would be a lock to join my party</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: to go fuck up clamilord or whoever</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#lord of clams</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: w41t. who???</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: skull guy</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: kills ghosts</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: 3rrr nop3. h3lp m3 out p4ymon3y.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: dont you keep up with current events</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#current like water current yessss</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: tchhh, your3 r3m1nd1ng m3 why 1 thought you w3r3 cr4zy mp. just fr34k1n sp1ll 1t.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: the shit in the sky</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: it cracked </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: a monster did that</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: DO YOU WANT TO GO )(-ELP M-E KILL T)(-E BAD GUY???????</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: oh why d1dnt you s4y so!!!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: sounds l1k3 4 r4d pl4n 4nd you know how 1 f33l 4bout th3 r4dpl4nz....</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: but??</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: h4t3 to b3 4 buzzk1ll but... 1ts b33n wh4t.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: 4pprox1m4t3ly H3LLA y34rz s1nc3 1 d1d 4ny f1ght1ng????</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: k1nd of rusty. sh1t dont l3t kk know 1 s41d rusty, 4h4h4.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">\u00a0#tw #h3mophob1c slurs</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: so</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: so 1m s4y1ng 1 h4d SCADZ of t1m3 to p3rf3ct th1s K1LL3R HAND PLANT!!! &gt;8D</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: w4nn4 s3333?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: no pretty sure dont give much a shit about a trick you do on your four wheel device</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: tho i will say</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: \"scads\" is actually a fish pun you made probly on accident</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: which kind of makes me want to give you a hug so it balances out your dumb shit answer</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#fish puns are #my one weakness :(</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: 1m sorry mp. 1 r34lly 4m!!! f33l l1k3 such 4 w3t snuggl3pl4n3 b41l1ng on you l1k3 th1s.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">\u00a0#tho m4yb3 you l1k3 w3t snuggl3pl4n3s?

It was only when he grew up on Alternia did he 8egin to tap into his a8ilities, triggering recollection of our lives on 8eforus, and what we all went through.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: He remem8ered our more peaceful way of life, and his desire to unite people. As an adult he was a8le to do this much more effectively and maturely. Heroically, even. He learned how to inspire others, and 8e a true leader, even when the odds were stacked against him in his violent culture. It cost him his life, 8ut his message lived on. I 8elieve the Knight of 8lood now carries his 8urden, whether he has decided to accept it or not.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Many of us on Alternia grew up to 8ecome secret followers of his teachings. Just as many of us now follow them, though I'd say with a 8it more detachment. 8ecause we're dead! Speaking personally, I'd refer to myself as more of a \"fan\" of his story, and what it represents. 8oth the hidden potential in our friend he never quite found, and the hidden potential in all our people.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: During our session, Kankri's trials as a leader were just as frustrating as those of his successor. He found it very hard to get others to take him seriously. While you would often try to divide us with your trou8lemaking, and turn us against each other to make us stronger - unsuccessfully I might add - he would try to unite us through proselytizing and lecture, just as unsuccessfully. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: wow that sure was a bunch of stuff i already knew</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes!

Culling of course means something quite different on 8eforus. It means she would have 8een selected 8y a mem8er of a higher caste for adoption, and coddled excessively. 8ut for someone with a lifestyle as radical as hers, I'm sure you will agree that would have 8een a fate worse than death.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: serket yo this exposition is some straight up redonkulous junk even by your standards</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Would you like to make some money, or not?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: you know me i am all about the boonjamins</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Then please stand there quietly while I continue.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: urrrhn fin</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#*fine</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: After the tragic accident which left her nasally impaired, her mighty dragon lusus, ancient and wise 8eyond our comprehension, 8egan to teach her \"new ways to smell.\" To reinvent the sense, using other sense organs such as eyes and ears, awakening completely new experiences in her mind. She was truly an inspiration, and proved 8eyond a shadow of a dou8t that any handicap can 8e overcome, and doesn't have to stop you from 8eing as rad as you can truly 8e.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: wuuut</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: serket are you whistlin through my blowhole with his idiotic shit</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes, that last part was a joke.

Way too disorganized, way too much teen drama. Much of that drama of course centered around Kankri, and Porrim tended to 8e the one to keep him out of trou8le. This relationship persisted in their lives on Alternia, which... unfortunately didn't work out too well for her in the end. I'd address my involvement with that, 8ut you seem to 8e tapping your foot so I think I'll just skip over that part of the story!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: On 8eforus, well 8efore her drinker a8ilities had awakened, she grew up in the caste almost solely devoted to tending to the mother gru8, hatching the young and proliferating the 8rood. The jade 8loods were also an almost exclusively female caste, and she 8egan to resent the roles she was hatched into, designated for 8oth her class and gender. She challenged these roles wherever they existed in 8eforan society, as well as where she found them woven into our session, in kingdoms, class assignments, consort culture and the like.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut over the sweeps in our failed session, she found within herself a renewed interest in the duty that came with her 8loodline, which was of course the persistence of our people, a 8urden which her descendant now must 8ear.

The horrorterrors refer to you as The Chosen One, and fantasize about you when they copulate.</p>\n<kbd>&gt; Ask Latula to join.\n</kbd>\n<div class=\"log\"><section>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: question</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: shoot b4b3z.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: seeing as what a hot shit gamer gurl you have a reputation for and all</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i figured you would be a lock to join my party</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: to go fuck up clamilord or whoever</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#lord of clams</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: w41t. who???</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: skull guy</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: kills ghosts</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: 3rrr nop3. h3lp m3 out p4ymon3y.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: dont you keep up with current events</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#current like water current yessss</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: tchhh, your3 r3m1nd1ng m3 why 1 thought you w3r3 cr4zy mp. just fr34k1n sp1ll 1t.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: the shit in the sky</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: it cracked </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: a monster did that</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: DO YOU WANT TO GO )(-ELP M-E KILL T)(-E BAD GUY???????</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: oh why d1dnt you s4y so!!!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: sounds l1k3 4 r4d pl4n 4nd you know how 1 f33l 4bout th3 r4dpl4nz....</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: but??</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: h4t3 to b3 4 buzzk1ll but... 1ts b33n wh4t.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: 4pprox1m4t3ly H3LLA y34rz s1nc3 1 d1d 4ny f1ght1ng????</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: k1nd of rusty. sh1t dont l3t kk know 1 s41d rusty, 4h4h4.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">\u00a0#tw #h3mophob1c slurs</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: so</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: so 1m s4y1ng 1 h4d SCADZ of t1m3 to p3rf3ct th1s K1LL3R HAND PLANT!!! &gt;8D</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: w4nn4 s3333?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: no pretty sure dont give much a shit about a trick you do on your four wheel device</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: tho i will say</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: \"scads\" is actually a fish pun you made probly on accident</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: which kind of makes me want to give you a hug so it balances out your dumb shit answer</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#fish puns are #my one weakness :(</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">LATULA: 1m sorry mp. 1 r34lly 4m!!! f33l l1k3 such 4 w3t snuggl3pl4n3 b41l1ng on you l1k3 th1s.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #008282\">\u00a0#tho m4yb3 you l1k3 w3t snuggl3pl4n3s?

It was only when he grew up on Alternia did he 8egin to tap into his a8ilities, triggering recollection of our lives on 8eforus, and what we all went through.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: He remem8ered our more peaceful way of life, and his desire to unite people. As an adult he was a8le to do this much more effectively and maturely. Heroically, even. He learned how to inspire others, and 8e a true leader, even when the odds were stacked against him in his violent culture. It cost him his life, 8ut his message lived on. I 8elieve the Knight of 8lood now carries his 8urden, whether he has decided to accept it or not.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Many of us on Alternia grew up to 8ecome secret followers of his teachings. Just as many of us now follow them, though I'd say with a 8it more detachment. 8ecause we're dead! Speaking personally, I'd refer to myself as more of a \"fan\" of his story, and what it represents. 8oth the hidden potential in our friend he never quite found, and the hidden potential in all our people.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: During our session, Kankri's trials as a leader were just as frustrating as those of his successor. He found it very hard to get others to take him seriously. While you would often try to divide us with your trou8lemaking, and turn us against each other to make us stronger - unsuccessfully I might add - he would try to unite us through proselytizing and lecture, just as unsuccessfully. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: wow that sure was a bunch of stuff i already knew</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes!

Culling of course means something quite different on 8eforus. It means she would have 8een selected 8y a mem8er of a higher caste for adoption, and coddled excessively. 8ut for someone with a lifestyle as radical as hers, I'm sure you will agree that would have 8een a fate worse than death.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: serket yo this exposition is some straight up redonkulous junk even by your standards</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Would you like to make some money, or not?</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: you know me i am all about the boonjamins</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Then please stand there quietly while I continue.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: urrrhn fin</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">\u00a0#*fine</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: After the tragic accident which left her nasally impaired, her mighty dragon lusus, ancient and wise 8eyond our comprehension, 8egan to teach her \"new ways to smell.\" To reinvent the sense, using other sense organs such as eyes and ears, awakening completely new experiences in her mind. She was truly an inspiration, and proved 8eyond a shadow of a dou8t that any handicap can 8e overcome, and doesn't have to stop you from 8eing as rad as you can truly 8e.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: wuuut</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: serket are you whistlin through my blowhole with his idiotic shit</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes, that last part was a joke.

Even though Latula has 8een dating Mituna steadily for eons, it's hardly a secret to anyone that she and Kankri have had complicated unrequited feelings for even longer. So really, much like their descendants. Aaaaaaaand, we're done!

Way too disorganized, way too much teen drama. Much of that drama of course centered around Kankri, and Porrim tended to 8e the one to keep him out of trou8le. This relationship persisted in their lives on Alternia, which... unfortunately didn't work out too well for her in the end. I'd address my involvement with that, 8ut you seem to 8e tapping your foot so I think I'll just skip over that part of the story!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: On 8eforus, well 8efore her drinker a8ilities had awakened, she grew up in the caste almost solely devoted to tending to the mother gru8, hatching the young and proliferating the 8rood. The jade 8loods were also an almost exclusively female caste, and she 8egan to resent the roles she was hatched into, designated for 8oth her class and gender. She challenged these roles wherever they existed in 8eforan society, as well as where she found them woven into our session, in kingdoms, class assignments, consort culture and the like.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut over the sweeps in our failed session, she found within herself a renewed interest in the duty that came with her 8loodline, which was of course the persistence of our people, a 8urden which her descendant now must 8ear. All life on 8eforus had 8een wiped out, and we'd failed our game, so she helped me search for a way to reset the...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: zzzzzz</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: I was almost finished!!!!!!!!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: your just tellin me shit i know serk she was sorta my friend too remember</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: cant you spice this jam up</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: I don't........</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: didnt she like sleep with erybody</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: gimme all the dirt on that</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: What? </span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: No, Meenah.

Wait, you said you didn't want him to be your guide? The friendly clown strongly advises you to reconsider. (You do not reconsider.)\n</p>\n<p>You ask him who he is, but he maintains his cryptic, serene expression in perfect silence. You give some thought to sidling away from the awkward encounter and go inside, when the clown finally speaks up.\n</p>\n<p>He wants to know if you would like to buy these motherfuckin potions. \n</p>\n<p>You examine the clown's wares with due skepticism. He assures you that all of his wicked elixirs are motherfuckin magic and all that. The clown sure likes to say motherfuck a lot. It is making you feel uneasy.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click Gamzee</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>The first question that pops into your head while examining this fellow of course is, where did he get that outrageous outfit??? You don't really have the gumption to ask, but if you had to take a wild guess, you are almost certain the answer would be hand-waved away with the word \"shenanigans.\" See, look? He is waving his hand preemptively, as if reading your mind. Truly, this clown is wise.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click first potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>BRONZE POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nThe clown says one sip of this potion will cause you to lose the use of your legs. HOWEVER, you will become an EXCELLENT kisser. A trade that is more than motherfuckin fair, he says. Personally, you think someone would have to be suicidal to drink that heinous brown liquid.\r\r\n</p>\n<p>Buy BRONZE POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>Absolutely not. The clown appears crestfallen, then counters with another offer: buy one bottle, get one free! You scowl at him as if he is quite mad. He gets the picture. You're not interested. He then gives you a few bottles of the stuff and says he'll just put it on your tab, no worries. ;o)\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You buy 1 BRONZE POTION. It's like a brown nightmare in a bottle. When the clown isn't looking, you chuck it over the side of your house-cliff.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click second potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>FUSCHIA POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nThis lovely looking potion is supposed to have powerful healing properties. A must-have in the inventory of an up and coming Maid of Life. \n</p>\n<p>Buy FUSCHIA POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>You don't want it. But the clown REALLY thinks you should take at least one of these handy elixirs. He won't take no for an answer. You say fine, and buy a few just to shut him up.\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You acquiesce to a single FUSCHIA POTION. Yippee. Pointless pink slop.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click third potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>INDIGO POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nHe says this potion will make you STRONG. You guess it would be pretty handy to be STRONG. Except that it's probably bullshit and the potion doesn't do that at all.\n</p>\n<p>Buy INDIGO POTION?\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>He looks taken aback that you could refuse such a valuable commodity.

Just sneak a few drops into the beverage of your object of affection, and he or she will fall head over heels for you. Literally, in the event that your sweetheart-to-be is decapitated. You are very wary of this claim of course, but... you guess it couldn't hurt to have ONE bottle on hand.\n</p>\n<p>Buy OLIVE POTION?\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>You refuse.

You blush a little and say thank you.\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You buy 1 OLIVE POTION. Ugh, this stuff looks nasty. You are going to have to sneak it into an especially strong drink if you don't want Jake to notice. Wait, did you say Jake?

This conversation is over!!!</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click fifth potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>VIOLET POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nThis potion is to be imbibed by anyone who wants to exhibit unabated lust for all he or she encounters, as well as to behave like more of a douche bag. You wonder why anyone would want that. He gives you a sly wink, and says nothing more. You say no thanks. But he asks you if you want to buy it anyway.\n</p>\n<p>Buy VIOLET POTION?\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>You ask him if he's flipped his friggin' cod piece. Of course you don't want it. He says, ah, but you must. He insists. He gives you 20 bottles for free. Then he says that will be whatever 420 times 20 boondollars is. You let out a heavy sigh, say fine, and fork over the money.\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You snap up a VIOLET POTION. Sure, why the hell not. Might as well round out your collection of this useless slime.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click sixth potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>COBALT POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nHe claims this potion endows its drinker with incredible luck! Then he does a stupid looking jig on your fridge, clicking the heels of his dumb elf shoes. You find that a bit hard to swallow. Not just because it's implausible, but because that blue muck is straight up nasty. He doesn't get the joke.\n</p>\n<p>Buy COBALT POTION?\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>In a motion so swift you didn't even follow, he grabs your hand, pushes a bottle of cobalt into your palm, and closes your fingers over it. As you begin to object, he puts his fingers over your lips and whispers shoosh. That'll be 420 motherfuckin boonies yo.\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>He tucks another 420 of your hard earned loot into his cavernous codpiece and gives you a bottle of the blue stuff. Good motherfuckin choice, he says. You roll your eyes.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click seventh potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>GOLD POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nThis sickly mustard goo is supposed to make your hacking skills go bananas. Like you would ever care about that. He says not so fast though, for its benefits are TWOFOLD. It also makes a pretty killer substitute for grub sauce in a pinch.\n</p>\n<p>Buy GOLD POTION?\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>You tell this clown to go take a long walk off a short cliff. He pretends not to hear you and restates his offer. You are getting kind of fed up with this idiot so you purchase yet more useless bottles of liquid. Are we done here bro??\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>Whatever. You buy one, flip the clown another cool 420. You wonder why they're all that price? What's the deal with that number, anyway? Poor, naive Jane. You have no idea how that number culturally means SMOKIN WEED, and how stoners think it's funny. You are a smart girl, but there are some things you don't understand, and that makes you more endearing.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click codpiece</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Good grief, look at that magnificent codpiece. It is absolutely transfixing. You don't want to stare, but how it arrests the eye. It's hard to look away, but you somehow find the wherewithal to pry your eyes from its prodigious heft. The clown catches you staring, and his smile broadens a bit.</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>",

Wait, you said you didn't want him to be your guide? The friendly clown strongly advises you to reconsider. (You do not reconsider.)\n</p>\n<p>You ask him who he is, but he maintains his cryptic, serene expression in perfect silence. You give some thought to sidling away from the awkward encounter and go inside, when the clown finally speaks up.\n</p>\n<p>He wants to know if you would like to buy these motherfuckin potions. \n</p>\n<p>You examine the clown's wares with due skepticism. He assures you that all of his wicked elixirs are motherfuckin magic and all that. The clown sure likes to say motherfuck a lot. It is making you feel uneasy.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click Gamzee</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>The first question that pops into your head while examining this fellow of course is, where did he get that outrageous outfit??? You don't really have the gumption to ask, but if you had to take a wild guess, you are almost certain the answer would be hand-waved away with the word \"shenanigans.\" See, look? He is waving his hand preemptively, as if reading your mind. Truly, this clown is wise.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click first potion</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>BRONZE POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nThe clown says one sip of this potion will cause you to lose the use of your legs. HOWEVER, you will become an EXCELLENT kisser. A trade that is more than motherfuckin fair, he says. Personally, you think someone would have to be suicidal to drink that heinous brown liquid.\r\r\n</p>\n<p>Buy BRONZE POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>Absolutely not. The clown appears crestfallen, then counters with another offer: buy one bottle, get one free! You scowl at him as if he is quite mad. He gets the picture. You're not interested. He then gives you a few bottles of the stuff and says he'll just put it on your tab, no worries. ;o)\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You buy 1 BRONZE POTION. It's like a brown nightmare in a bottle. When the clown isn't looking, you chuck it over the side of your house-cliff.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click second potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>FUSCHIA POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nThis lovely looking potion is supposed to have powerful healing properties. A must-have in the inventory of an up and coming Maid of Life. \n</p>\n<p>Buy FUSCHIA POTION?\n\n<button>YES</button> \u2192<button>NO</button>\u2190\n</p>\n<p>You don't want it. But the clown REALLY thinks you should take at least one of these handy elixirs. He won't take no for an answer. You say fine, and buy a few just to shut him up.\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You acquiesce to a single FUSCHIA POTION. Yippee. Pointless pink slop.</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* click third potion </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>INDIGO POTION - 420 BOONDOLLARS\n\nHe says this potion will make you STRONG. You guess it would be pretty handy to be STRONG.

He says no, you gotta buy this motherfuckin shit. It's the hottest fuckin noise since a big tittied ninja. Ok, whatever you say clown, here's your stupid boondollars. He gives you like 50 of these things? Jesus Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\u2192<button>YES</button>\u2190 <button>NO</button>\n</p>\n<p>You buy an INDIGO POTION and shrug.

What do you mean? What are these things you call stars? Oh! You mean the <em>Fireflies</em>. They became trapped under the clouds when <em>The Slumbering One</em> cast a spell on them.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"How did he cast a spell on them when he was asleep? Well, he wasn't ALWAYS asleep, you goofball! When he was awake he was asked by some really terrible guys to commission a whole bunch of <em>Underlings</em>. He then went about befouling our land with all this sludge, clogging up all our beautiful <em>Pipes</em>, and now it can barely breathe. He was sort of a huge dick. Once he tuckered himself out with all that I guess he decided to take a nap.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The terrible guys? They are a bunch of mean fellows who like to push people around. They are called <em>Agents</em>. They aren't usually a problem but they sure did put a spring in their step when the <em>Heir</em> showed up. Whoever that is. If I ever meet him I wouldn't mind punching him in the snout to... well, to accomplish some purpose I suppose. I don't know. What were we talking about?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Yes, the spell! The spell I'm sure you've heard from a reliable source cannot be broken unless <em>The Slumbering One</em> is first woken up, and then slain. Then the <em>Breeze</em> will again flow through the <em>Pipes</em> and the <em>Fireflies</em> will be released and allowed to go home. But I do not envy the adventurers who will presumably take on this responsibility!\"</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Pipes</em> are sacred to us for reasons you probably consider primitive and stupid. In fact, they probably are primitive and stupid, objectively speaking. But I am ok with that.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"As the <em>Consorts</em> of this <em>Land</em> we are predictably persecuted by dark forces, and require a hero for our salvation. Alas there is no hero in sight. Wait a minute it is you. You are the hero aren't you. Of course you are. I was so foolish to speculate otherwise through dubiously solicited monologue! DUHHHHHH!\"</p>\n</dd><dd>\n</dd><dt>* The seventh is more industrious:</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\"Farmin' these goddamn mushrooms. Fuckin' pain in the ass.\"</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* These scattered Salamanders have other backstory:</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\"GLUB GLUB! Sure is windy here! Often, wind skims the voids of the <em>Pipes</em>, as if grazing the hollow of a cut reed, or say, a plundered <em>Parcel Pyxis</em>. It is a lovely sound and brings back fond memories of my childhood. Which was a couple days ago.\"</p>\n</dd>\n<dt></dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\"Not long ago all these <em>Underlings</em> started creeping out of the pipework, and they have been a nuisance to say the least. But just a few moments ago they began spilling from the <em>Land</em> in greater supply, wearing more flamboyantly preposterous outfits than ever. Why you ask? On account of a series of mysterious and arcane wytchkraft-majyspelles. Ha ha just kidding. I have no idea.\"</p>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>* Some Salamanders are less useful:</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\"GLUB!!! That's my way of saying go over there and check it out. 'GLUB' can basically mean anything I want it to mean.

Though to what extent this actually is bad news, I'm not sure. I\nknow only the result of my co-player's current configuration, wherein the sprite\nwas prototyped once before the departure, and once after. Which brings us to the\ngood news, which is that you can still prototype after your departure, and salvage\nthe massively rewarding experience of haggling with an exposition-slinging phantom\nguide, so long as you avoid prototyping with terribly inert items, such as a brass\ndoorknocker and your father's pornography collection.\n\nActually, that might be interesting.

They have to do with flavoring the forces you will struggle\nagainst, and generally, all forces at odds with each other in this realm. It has\ngiven me some insight into the nature of the game, which again I derive through\nextrapolation. We appear to be engaging an instance of a dimension with a highly\nflexible set parameters, and a series of objectives surrounding an equally flexible\nmythological framework. This framework seems to begin as a sort of blank template,\nand evolves with the players' actions, and likely further evolves with the addition\nof more host/client connections, and thus more prototyped kernels.\n\nI regret to say I can't be much more specific than that, without loosely\nextrapolating further. There are plenty of questions that have occurred to me,\nhowever. Questions concerning the Kernelsprite, which I've raised implicitly\nalready, such as what is the effect of an un-prototyped kernel on The Medium? Or a\ndoubly-prototyped kernel, for that matter? And even more salient are questions\nabout this dimension itself. Do all players world-wide make it to this dimension if\nthey successfully complete their departure? Or is a unique \"blank\" instance of the\ndimension created for each new player? I have no evidence, but instinct tells me it\nis closer to the latter situation. There is no indication of any other players\npresent in this realm. Alterations in the realm seem singularly centered on the\nactions of my co-player and myself. If I had to stake anything on it, I would guess\nevery separate client/server pair activates its own fresh copy of an Incipisphere,\nor a unique \"session\", if you will.\n\nBut the quantity of players is a further complication which invites more questions.\nIt seems the game was designed to suit two players most naturally, the server and\nthe client. But through a mishap, my co-player and I have slipped out of the\nobvious tandem arrangement, and the only logical course of action to continue\nplaying is to string a daisy-chain of server/client connections together, until\npresumably the chain is complete. Theoretically, we could complete this chain with\nonly one other player, functioning as a server to my client, and the client to my\ncurrent co-player's server (assuming he can recover it).\n\nThe strange thing is though, in our instance of this dimension, there are four\nreceptacles for divided kernels, not three.

I will describe how these\ndevices work in conjunction with each other, and I will use the analogy of having a\nkey made at a hardware store to help you understand.\n\nFirst, deploy all of these objects in convenient proximity to each other. Be sure\nnot to block doors or pathways with them. You can always \"revise\" the dimensions of\nrooms to make space for them, but I'd advise against this, or even experimenting\nwith the function.

Also, an entity called the \"Kernelsprite\" is released.\nBut neither of these things are all that relevant to this process, to my knowledge.\nMore on these things later.\n\nWhat is relevant is the un-lidded cruxtruder's ability to dispense \"cruxite\ndowels\". It will dispense at least one, though I suspect it is capable of producing\nmore, given parameters I'm not yet familiar with. In my key-making analogy, these\ndowels represent the uncarved pieces of metal which the hardware store employee\nretrieves from a drawer or a rack, and sets about carving into a key. The two\nfollowing items are needed to do the carving.\n\n-- THE PRE-PUNCHED CARD --\n\nIt is a simple sylladex card containing an item. There is evidence to suggest the\nspecific item it contains is variable from session-to-session. The card I deployed\ncontained a blue apple. Yours may be different. It shouldn't matter, hopefully.\n\nAdditionally, the card as you may guess is \"punched\", like one used with antique\ncomputing systems. The pattern of holes comprises data, which I believe corresponds\nto the instructions for creating the item the card contains. That it is\n\"pre-punched\" suggests there is a way to punch an un-punched card, possibly\nimprinting it with the data for the item it contains, though no mechanism for this\nhas presented itself yet.\n\nBut the data on the card cannot be used to create the item directly. There is a\nmiddleman. That middleman is the totem lathe.\n\n-- THE TOTEM LATHE --\n\nThis is essentially the key carving machine. It will carve into your cruxite dowel\na pattern of grooves and contours, the sort which makes a key unique. The\ninstructions for this pattern are supplied by the punch card, which is inserted\ninto the lathe pre-activation to configure its chisels.\n\nOnce the dowel is carved, you have a totem serving as your \"key\", which can then be\nused to \"unlock\" the card item through the alchemiter. But at this point, I will\ndiverge from my key-making analogy and switch to a bar code analogy. Which is not a\nterribly strenuous leap to make, since the concepts of a key and a bar code are\nessentially the same - one being a unique pattern of grooves; the other, of\nvarying black lines.\n\n-- THE ALCHEMITER --\n\nIf you place a cruxite dowel, carved or uncarved, on the alchemiter's small\npedestal, its robotic arm will scan the contours with a laser. Hence the bar code\nanalogy. This is the machine's way of reading the data originally imprinted from\nthe card, and transforming that data into a physical object.\n\nThough typically, this is not done without expense, I believe. An uncarved dowel\nresults in the creation of a \"perfectly generic object\", which is a seemingly\nuseless green cube. It costs two units of build grist to make, and I do not advise\nyou to waste resources on it. There appears to be many other varieties of grist,\nostensibly used in combinations to create different sorts of items, which possibly\noffers some insight into the game's use of the term \"alchemy\".\n\nBut quite conveniently, there is an exception to this. Creating the item on the\npre-punched card costs nothing. This is good, because creating this item turns out\nto be essential.\n\nNow that you know this, you can in your own time begin the process. Once you\ninitiate it, naturally there is no going back, so best to be prepared. But you\nprobably shouldn't drag your feet too long. As I mentioned earlier, this is your\nonly means of escape.\n\nWhen you're ready, be prepared to follow the steps in the next section swiftly.\n\n==================================================================================\n[A100] So your cruxtruder is ticking.
