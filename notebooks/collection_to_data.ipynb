Caliborn's aim is to undermine and ridicule everything, from the protagonist's struggles to the art itself. Despite his effort to hijack the narrative, Caliborn unwittingly contributes to the story's continuation, as items left by The Author lead him to unlock new content, extending Homestuck even as he tries to derail it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main narrative, the players have just arrived to the new session. The scattered kids face challenges under the Condesce's plan to take over their session and its nascent Universe, with Jade and Jane falling under her control, and Jake, Roxy and Dirk imprisoned or otherwise AWOL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aranea uses the Ring of Life juju to come back to life. After a massive battle, where most characters die due to the Condesce and Aranea's meddling, John meets his Denizen in desperation, and gains a power to jump across the canon of the narrative itself. Directed by a dying Terezi's instructions, John \"retcons\" events so that Vriska survives instead of dying. Vriska takes an active role in helping the group strategize for the upcoming showdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final ACT ACT ACT, Caliborn shows a \"spoiler to the ending of things\" in Claymation form. In his tale, eight kids show up to defeat him, and four of them (which seem to be some version of John, Rose, Dave and Jade) are trapped inside a house-shaped juju. The four remaining combatants, implied to be the Alpha Kids, cause the ultimate defeat of Caliborn, but also the creation of Lord English. The ultimate villain is revealed to be a product of the combined essences of Caliborn, Arquiusprite, and Gamzee, created as an unwitting side effect of one Dirk's attack. A combination of their souls is trapped inside the Lil Cal juju, which is (only temporally, as we've previously seen) sent into the Void by one Roxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present time and session, and with proper planning, an even more intense battle ensues. It involves all of the main players, Spades Slick, Lord Jack, and The Condesce. Roxy manages to land a killing blow on The Condesce, and Dave and Dirk defeat the Jacks. Avoiding all casualties, the players reunite at the victory lilypad, where Calliope is resurrected, finally able to take her place in the waking world.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a long sequence of post-battle conversations, the players use the power of the Forge and the Genesis Frog create a new universe, Universe C. In the Furthest Ring, the alternate Calliope, the Muse of Space, helps collapse the Green Sun into a Black Hole, where Vriska deploys the secret weapon against Lord English, a house-shaped juju, but his defeat is not shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surviving players and their allies pass through the door to claim the Ultimate Reward: a new world for themselves, where the previous Earth B (now C) is placed and prepared to support new life. The players are crowned as the creators of this new universe, and they begin to rebuild civilization. The story concludes with a hint that John still needs to return to finish the job and defeat Caliborn, a closed loop that will end with Lord English's creation.\"\"\"\n",

Arquiusprite joins, taunting Cans with quadrupedal automata and the fridge in which Gamzee is still locked. Cans clocks Jake, Arquius, and several Felt to Lofaf, where Clover humiliates Karkat, and again back to Lomax. Crowbar shoots and kills Jake.\n",

The fight on Derse reaches its most chaotic and madcap when Cans clocks Arquius and the fridge into it. Next, the healers go to Lomax and resurrect Jake. Everyone loves Nanna’s cookies. Jane stays to fight aside Jake. Casey von Salamancer’s skeleton army overruns the combatants.\n",

    "The Archagent gets Dirk in a hold with his crowbar. Spades Slick gets the Archagent in a hold with his cuestaff. Their heads are all lined up, so Dave takes the shot. He decapitates them and breaks the unbreakable katana in one blow. Then, for the first time since his old session, Dave uses time travel. He recovers Dirk’s head and body and evacuates Terezi from Lotak. Their enemies may be dead, but the Archagent’s cursed clockwork head is a bomb. It implodes into a black hole, taking the fridge and most of Lotak with it.\n",

Thankfully, for each panel we have the image AND useful page and panel metadata.\\nYou will be given input that contains transcripts of the text onscreen, the content under the panels with dialogue and narration, and some more metadata.\\nThe image alongside will be the panel itself. Here's an example of the metadata input:\\n```\\n{\\\"title\\\": \\\"Jade: Keep going.\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Oh yeah. How could you forget about his stash of DECREPIT MUMMIES.<br /><br />God you hate these things.\\\", \\\"page_id\\\": \\\"002753\\\", \\\"src\\\": \\\"/storyfiles/hs2/00853_1.gif\\\", \\\"pov_characters\\\": [\\\"Jade\\\"], \\\"pov_commands\\\": [[\\\"Jade: Proceed through house\\\", \\\"Jade: Be trolled by Karkat\\\"]], \\\"transcript_class\\\": null, \\\"transcript_style\\\": null, \\\"transcript_tag\\\": null, \\\"transcript\\\": null, \\\"page_commentary\\\": null, \\\"page_notes\\\": null, \\\"theme\\\": null, \\\"flag\\\": []}\\n```\\nAnd an example of your tagged output, which must be a valid JSON list:\\n```\\n[\\\"Jade Harley\\\", \\\"Jade's House\\\", \\\"Blue Sun Shirt\\\", \\\"Stairs\\\", \\\"Dead\\\", \\\"Light Symbol\\\"]\\n```\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"{\\\"title\\\": \\\"Dear John,\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are no doubt reading this as a handsome and strapping young man! Why, the mangrit needed to lift the book is itself a sign of your maturity, not even to speak of the wisdom needed to grasp the nuance of <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Sassacre</span>'s time-tested mischief. I am so proud of you, grandson!<br /><br />How I wish I could have delivered this heirloom to you in the flesh. But I am afraid it wasn't in the cards! For you see, John, like you, this book must yet take a journey! Its journey will end on the <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Final Day</span> of my life, and even then will continue some. Though I suppose that will be up to your <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Father</span>. Perhaps he will discuss it with you one day, when he and you are ready.<br /><br />But it is your journey I am writing about to wish you luck! There will come a day when you will be thrust into another world. And once you arrive, that is only the beginning! You will soon delve even deeper into a realm of <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Warring Royalty</span> in a <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Timeless Expanse</span>. A realm of <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Agents</span> and <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Exiles</span> and <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Consorts</span> and <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Kernelsprites</span>. Of toiling <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Underlings</span> and slumbering <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Denizens</span>. A realm where four will gather, the <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Heir of Breath</span> and <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Seer of Light</span>, the <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Knight of Time</span> and <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Witch of Space</span>, and together they will <span style=\\\\\\\"text-decoration: underline\\\\\\\">Ascend</span>.<br /><br />John, if only you knew how important you were! I regret my passing came so early in your life. And yet I feel in my heart we have already met.
