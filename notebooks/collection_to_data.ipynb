Caliborn's aim is to undermine and ridicule everything, from the protagonist's struggles to the art itself. Despite his effort to hijack the narrative, Caliborn unwittingly contributes to the story's continuation, as items left by The Author lead him to unlock new content, extending Homestuck even as he tries to derail it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main narrative, the players have just arrived to the new session. The scattered kids face challenges under the Condesce's plan to take over their session and its nascent Universe, with Jade and Jane falling under her control, and Jake, Roxy and Dirk imprisoned or otherwise AWOL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aranea uses the Ring of Life juju to come back to life. After a massive battle, where most characters die due to the Condesce and Aranea's meddling, John meets his Denizen in desperation, and gains a power to jump across the canon of the narrative itself. Directed by a dying Terezi's instructions, John \"retcons\" events so that Vriska survives instead of dying. Vriska takes an active role in helping the group strategize for the upcoming showdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final ACT ACT ACT, Caliborn shows a \"spoiler to the ending of things\" in Claymation form. In his tale, eight kids show up to defeat him, and four of them (which seem to be some version of John, Rose, Dave and Jade) are trapped inside a house-shaped juju. The four remaining combatants, implied to be the Alpha Kids, cause the ultimate defeat of Caliborn, but also the creation of Lord English. The ultimate villain is revealed to be a product of the combined essences of Caliborn, Arquiusprite, and Gamzee, created as an unwitting side effect of one Dirk's attack. A combination of their souls is trapped inside the Lil Cal juju, which is (only temporally, as we've previously seen) sent into the Void by one Roxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present time and session, and with proper planning, an even more intense battle ensues. It involves all of the main players, Spades Slick, Lord Jack, and The Condesce. Roxy manages to land a killing blow on The Condesce, and Dave and Dirk defeat the Jacks. Avoiding all casualties, the players reunite at the victory lilypad, where Calliope is resurrected, finally able to take her place in the waking world.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a long sequence of post-battle conversations, the players use the power of the Forge and the Genesis Frog create a new universe, Universe C. In the Furthest Ring, the alternate Calliope, the Muse of Space, helps collapse the Green Sun into a Black Hole, where Vriska deploys the secret weapon against Lord English, a house-shaped juju, but his defeat is not shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surviving players and their allies pass through the door to claim the Ultimate Reward: a new world for themselves, where the previous Earth B (now C) is placed and prepared to support new life. The players are crowned as the creators of this new universe, and they begin to rebuild civilization. The story concludes with a hint that John still needs to return to finish the job and defeat Caliborn, a closed loop that will end with Lord English's creation.\"\"\"\n",
